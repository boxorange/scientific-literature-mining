               Abstract
               
                  Product yields and collision density are calculated for nuclear-recoil tritium ions generated in situ with 4 Mkcal/mole of translational energy in gaseous methane or methane mixed with argon. The distribution of collision experienced in the reactive region and the yield of stable products are independent of the starting energy when it is large.

Washington 98195, USA    Received 19 December 1983    The possibility that a heavy atom can block internal energy transfer in excited species has been further investigated by  chemical activation study of 4-( trimethyl lead)-2-butyl and 5-(trimethyl tin)-2-pentyl radicals. These radicals were prepared  and excited by the reaction of H atoms with the corresponding 1-olef ns. Energy randomization was found to occur on a  subp cosecond time scale in all the radicals studied.    1. Introduction    In recent studies of the 3-(triaUyi tin)-2-fluoro- !-  propyi radical [I], and the corresponding germanium  radical [2] activated by the reaction F + tetraallyl  metal, Rogers, Rowland et al. (RR) measured the rate  of formation of fluoroethylene. They found that the  observed rate constants Ag fell between those obtained  from a propene substrate (==1.4 X 10 s*) and from  butene-1 (^5 X 107 s~1). They concluded that the  excess vibrational energy of the activated radical did  not randomize beyond the central metal atom and  was effectively confined to one side chain only.    We have studied energy relaxation in the past de-  cade using the chemical activation technique on flu-  orocarbons [3,4] and hydrocarbons [3 6]- Internal  relaxation times were deduced with use of a model  that assumes that a vibrational subset (moiety) of the  radical is initially excited and that its excess energy  decays exponentially with time in a manner crudely  characterized by a single time-independent average  relaxation constant A- Details of the model and discus-  sion of assumptions were given in refs. [3,4]   and  earlier citations therein. We were stimulated by the  work of RR and by classical trajectory calculations of  Lopez and Marcus [7] to apply our model to RR's    Work supported by the National Science Foundation.  ** See summary table in r f. [3].    results; a reasonable fit to the data was obtained [6] if    takes a value of 1010 s~1, or less, in the 3&lt;triallyl  tin)-2-fluoropropyl radical system. Such a value for X  differs markedly from our recent study on the 4-(tri-  methyl tin)-2-butyl radical [6] and earlier results on  alkyi radical and fluorocarbon internal relaxation  times at comparable energies [3 5], for which internal  relaxation times A" of magnitude 0.2 to 2 ps were  deduced.    We have now extended our work on tin and lead  substrates. The latter with its larger central mass  affords a more severe test of the adequacy of the  statistical assumption of RRKM theory. We report  here chemical activation studies on energy relaxation  in 5-(trimethyl tin)-2-pentyl and4-(trimethyl lead)-2-  butyl radicals, formed by H-atom addition to the cor-  responding 1-olef ns.    2. Chemical activation study of the (trimethyl  metal)-2-butyl and -2-pentyl radicals    Rate constants for propene formation from ex-  cited (trimethyl metal)-2-butyl and -2-pentyl radicals  were measured at 298 K over a range of hydrogen bath  gas pressures from 2 to 1000 Torr- If the metal atom  blocks energy transfer, then the limiting rate of pro-  pene formation would be similar to that from a smaller  1-butene or 1-pentene substrate which have been well    521    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    studied in earlier work from this laboratory [8,9] ; if  energy relaxation occurs, then a lower rate, similar to  that from a Cg or a  9 substrate, would be observed.    2.7. Materials and procedure    The method of synthesis and purification of the  tin and lead alkyi compounds was the same as before  [6]. 4-bromo-l-but ne and 5-bromo-l-pentene were  obtained from Aldrich Chem. Co. The trimethyl metal  bromides were Alfa Products. Each product was a  colorless liquid and was characterized by NMR and  mass spectrometry. These compounds had vapor pres-  sures between 1 and 3 Torr at 300 K.    The vacuum apparatus and procedure were identi-  cal with that described earlier [6]. Two quartz reac-  tion vessels were used, 500 ml for low-pressure runs  (&lt;1 atm) and 2000 ml at higher pressures, with over-  lap. The rate of propene formation was measured by  using the internal standard, 2-methyl-l-butene (2MB1),  whose rate of decomposition to isobutene is known  [6,8]. Hydrogen atoms were produced by the 2537 A  mercury photosensitized decomposition of the hydro-  gen bath gas. The percentage reaction was &lt;10% and  usually below 5%. The products were analyzed on a  100 ft SCOT squalane column at 0 C.    3. Results    The following reaction scheme was given [6] for  4-(trimethyl tin)-l-butene; the present compounds  exhibit a similar mechanism:    (CH3)3Sn-C-C-C=C + H    ^ (CH3)3Sn-C-C~C-CH (MTB-2*),    P  MTB-2* -^ (CH3)3SnC + C-C=C (D&amp;) ,    (1)    (2)    -^(CH3)3SnC-C-C-CH (*MTB-2).

Some ethylene is formed as a result of anti-Mar-  kovnikov addition to the double bond with subsequent  decomposition of the excited w-radical. More ethylene  of as yet unknown origin had been formed in the tin  butyl system than was expected, but is reduced in  amount to expected levels in the present tin pentyl  system.

The stabilized C5Hn can recombine or disproportion-  ate and forms 2MB2 as a stabilization product.    The rate constant for propene formation is A^ =   toDP/S, where D^S is related to the 2MB1 standard  as follows [8],    S/DP=(Jr/Jrs)(//n(DS/DP)(SS/DS+ 1) - 1 .    D5 was obtained from A| = {SuD^S1', using a value AI =  3.8 X 106 s"1 [S];x and Xs are the mole fractions of  the metal alkyi and 2MB1, respectively. 2MB2 is a  measure of 5s, from the relationship 5s = 14.5 [2MB2] ;    this was obtained by assuming a disproportionation   recombination ratio for 2-methyl-2-butyl and the  metal alkyi radicals of 0.4 by comparison with the  2-methyl-2-butyl and 4,4-dimethyl-2-hexyl system [9].    was taken 0.2 for hydrogen [5,8] and the collision  frequency w was calculated using diameters (table 1)  adjusted by a 12-6 potential [12],S^M =  IM^M' -    Plots ofk]i against logio(pressure/Torr) for the two  substrates are given in fig. 1- k^ showed a small, but  unimportant systematic increase with pressure ofun-  diagnosed nature in the lead but ne system, and the  mean value was close to that predicted for propene  formation from a completely randomized radical.

An Ziniin value of 40 kcal mol"1 was used for all  substrates, with o = 29.5 kcal mol~1 for the tin com-  pounds and 30 kcal mol - for the lead compounds.  These energetics are similar to those used in hydro-  carbon radical systems [3 5]. The value of/Tmm was  maintained the same for both random and non-ran-  dom decomposition.

Conclusions    The calculated plots ofk^ against logio(pressure/  Torr) for different assumed internal energy relaxation  rates, A, of the RR moieties are shown together with  the experimental data in fig. 1. These plots predict a  strong pressure dependence offcj^ over the experimen-  tal pressure range if the tin or lead atoms block inter-  nal energy transfer. This is not observed. The low,  relatively constant values indicate that propene is  formed after energy relaxation has occurred in the ex-  cited radicals. These radicals therefore behave in a  similar manner to the hydrocarbon radicals studied  previously [3  5]. The heavy atom does not appear to  block internal energy transfer on a picosecond time  scale.

The reason  for the difference must still be sought. It may be noted  that 6- and 7-membered chains can undergo internal  collisions, but such a possibility has not previously  prevented the illustration of initial non-random de-  composition in hexyl [3,4] and methyl hexyl radical  systems [5]. The trajectory calculations ofLopez and  Marcus [7] demonstrate the dependence of their con-  clusions on the nature of the assumed molecular hamil-  tonian, on its geometry, and on the central atom  blocking mass. At this stage, they provide no crucial  diagnostic principle that may be applied to these sys-  tems to resolve the disagreement-  References    [1] P.J. Rogers, D.C. Montague, J.P. Frank, S.C.

Introduction    The free jet expansion technique coupled with  laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) has  been a remarkably prolific field, providing detailed  information concerning the structure and dynamics  of weakly bound van der Waals complexes [I], Initial  studies were confined to the van der Waals adducts of  stable molecules, owing to the technical difficulties  involved in producing transients such as free radicals  and molecular ions in the jet. However, in the last few  years a number of methods for producing transients  in a free jet, without serious perturbation of the gas  flow, have been developed. Laser photolysis of stable  precursors has been used to generate free radicals [2   5], while molecular ions have been produced by elec-  tron impact [6 8] and multiphoton ionization [9,10]-    In a previous communication [9], we reported the  observation ofUF from molecular ion inert gas clus-  ters formed in a free jet expansion. Ionic clusters are  particularly interesting because their binding energies  are intermediate between a "true chemical bond" and  the weak van der Waals interaction characteristic be-  tween neutrals. Because of their relative stability they  play important roles in a variety of chemical systems,  such as the earth's upper atmosphere, combusion  reactions, electrical discharges, and are even believed      Present address: Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute  of Technology, Chicago, Illinois 60616. USA.    526    to exist in some interstellar media [11] - Clearly, un-  derstanding the formation and structure of ionic clus-  ters is relevant for a wide variety of related fields.    In this letter we report our initial LIF studies of  bound complexes formed between hexafluorobenzene  cation (M'1") and various inert gases (X), specifically  He, Ne and Ar. Each M'^-X^ cluster studied exhibits a  spectrum essentially identical to M"1" but red-shifted in  energy. We report upon the spectral shifts, linewidths  and formation for each cluster and offer observations  relevant to the mechanism for inert gas addition.    1. Experimental    The basic apparatus has been previously described  [3]- We utilize a cw "Camparque" type supersonic  expansion with a 250 pm diameter nozzle and inert  gas stagnation pressure ranging from 2 to 40 atm. The  gas system is design to perform on-line mixing of  gases at high pressures. The hexafluorobenzene pre-  cursor was seeded in the carrier gas prior to expansion  at a concentration of a few hundred ppm. The liquid  was held in a metal container which was immersed in  a constant temperature bath ( 20 to 50  C), permit-  ting accurate control of the CgFg vapor pressure.    Photoionization (PI) in the jet was accomplished  by absorption of two 193 run photons from a  Lumorocs 460-3 ArF* excimer laser. The ArF* laser  was focused and apertured to produce an interaction    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    region with the jet of  =2 mm. The PI region was typi-  cally located 13 nozzle diameters (ND) downstream  of the nozzle but this distance could be accurately  varied to  0.5 ND.    The counter-propagation LIF probe was a Molectron  N- pumped dye laser which was focused to a 0.5 nun  beam waist, its distance downstream of the PI region  was 30 ND. The dye laser was temporally delayed  with respect to the ArF* laser to permit the ion pulse  to arrive at the probe region. The LIF was imaged on  a photomultiplier tube by an optical system that spa-  tially discriminated against scattered light. The signal  was then fed to a gated integrator and subsequently  stored in a computer.    Electric field studies were performed using parallel  plates separated by 1 cm- The E field was perpendicu-  lar to the jet axis and variable from 0 to 250 V/cm.  The E Held was located  5 ND downstream of the PI  region and extended for ^10 ND. The dye laser inter-  rogated the ions in a relatively field free region 10 ND  downstream of the plates. Application of the E field  produces a force on the ions perpendicular to the jet  axis, therefore inducing random collisions between  the ions and the neutral carrier gas. Thus, by controll-  ing the energy of these collisions in a crude way via  the E field strength, we are able to study the disap-  pearance of various ion clusters as a function ofjE'.    3. Results    We recently reported the first LIF of a multiple  argon atom complex of an organic cation [9]. This  paper represents a logical extension of that work.  Results are reported for clustering of He, Ne and Ar  to hexafluorobenzene cation and LIF spectra are pre-  sented for ionic clusters with discrete numbers of inert  gas atoms, M"1"-^ for n = l, 2, 3...  . Each cluster  spectrum has associated with it the LIF spectrum of  CgFg, i.e. M"1". In all cases the M"*" spectra observed  were "cold". In previous room-temperature LIF  studies [12], spectral linewidths typically were 20   40 cm"1 due to rotational contours and vibrational  sequence congestion- In the present experiments the  spectral lines ofM"*^ are narrow and laser linewidth  limited at  s l cm"1 - The M4' spectrum shows excel-  leng agreement with previously reported jet spectra  [10,13] of the ion. Each ionic cluster is identified by    three features: (i) its spectral shift from the M"*" spec-  trum, (ii) its intensity dependence upon stagnation  pressure, and (in) its dependence on an applied elec-  tric field.    3.1. Spectroscopy of helium clusters    Fig. 1 shows a series of LIF spectra obtained fol-  lowing photoionization of an expansion of pure he-  lium seeded with hexafluorobenzene. The sharp peak  at 21616 cm~1 in fig. 1A is the 0-0 electronic origin  ofM4'. In fig. 1B the stagnation pressure is doubled to  200 psi and there is the emergence of a sharp peak at  21578 cm-1, which is red-shifted by 38 cm-1 with  respect to the 0 0 transition ofM"1". hi fact, a similar    GeF^ IN Helium          P=26atm    M He    (B)    (A)    P=6.6alm    21500    21600  CM"1    21700    F . 1.

In fig. 1 C with the back-  ing pressure raised to 400 psi a second sharp feature  appears red-shifted by 81 cm-1 which we assign  to the M^-He-i cluster. (The 20 cm-1 broad lines  shifted by +15 cm~1 and  23 cm-1 away from  the M"1" electronic origin arise from a different clus-  ter species, which will be discussed later.) In fig. -  ID at 600 psi backing pressure an additional sharp  peak appears red-shifted by 86 cm"1 which we assign  as the M'^-He^ cluster. Note the reduction in the in-  tensity of the M"1' peak as the backing pressure is in-  creased because of the competitive paths of ion-  ionic cluster formation in the jet. (Again in fig. ID  there are other broad cluster peaks at  83,  32 and  +24 cm"1- However, the M'^-He^ peaks are easily dis-  criminated by their 1 cm"1 linewidths.)    Besides the evidence of spectral position and stag-  nation pressure dependence, there is an additional  means for distinguishing between cluster transitions    and those of the bare ion, M"^. This method involves,  the application of an electric field perpendicular to  the nozzle axis. All ionic species, clusters or not, will  be accelerated along the field lines, thereby greatly in-  creasing their number of two-body collisions. The  weakly bound clusters will fragment much more  readily than M"'" species, which will be principally just  heated by the process. The M"^ species will persist at.  higher E fields than the M"*"-X  clusters. (If one degree  of freedom, e.g. vibration, is strongly out of equilib-  rium and hotter, it might appear to cool. However,  its detailed behavior in terms of linewidth and in-  tensity as a function of field would likely be much  different from cluster species.)    -Fig. 2 shows the Mt spectrum taken in a He ex-  pansion at different electric field strengths. As the  electric field is increased from 0 V/cm in fig. 2A to  160 V/cm in fig. 2D, the peaks labeled Z disappear  at 80 V/cm while the.peaks labeled X and Y broaden  but persist even at 160 V/cm. This is consistent with  our prior assignment of the Z peaks to the M'^-He  cluster and the X and Y peaks to the M4' species. We    CcFe* IN HELIUM          21800.    22200.    22000.

Spectroscopy of neon clusters    Fig. 3 shows the low-frequency portion of the ex-  citation spectrum of the hexafluorobenzene cation in  a neon expansion. The peak at 21616 cm~1 is the 0-0  electronic origin ofM"*" and the 56 cm"1 red-shifted  satellite we assign to the M^'-Ne cluster. The single  neon cluster peak is relatively sharp, 2 3 cm~1, and  found as a  56 cm"1 satellite peak of each vibronic  transition ofM4". As the stagnation pressure is increas-  ed, there emerges four 20 cm"1 broaden satellite  peaks at  105, -60,  39, and +15 cm-1. The same  15 cm"1 blue-shifted peak appears in both the he-  lium and neon expansion. The spectrum for M^Ne^,  which would be expected to be red-shifted by ^ 110  cm"1, has not been observed but we attribute this  fact to the spectral congestion due to the broader  peaks at higher backing pressures.    3.3. Spectroscopy of argon clusters    The Ar cluster spectra were taken using an Ar He  mixture, varying the percentage of Ar. In a jet, argon  atoms ef ciently cluster with molecules and atoms,  thus making it difficult to control the fine balance of  M'^-Ar^ size production in a pure Ar expansion.    Fig. 4 shows the changes in the spectrum as the  percentage of Ar is increased- The narrow peak in  both traces is the origin of the M'*" spectrum- In fig-  4A the broad satellite peak whose center is red-shifted    P,=17otm    (B)    (A)          21300-       21400.       21500.       21600.       21700.

The  M^Ar linewidth is  55 cm"1 which is substantially  broader than the bare ion or any of the He and Ne  M"*"-?^ clusters. A recent LIF study [8] observed the  same M'^-Ar satellite line using electron bombardment  production of CgF^ in an argon expansion. Upon in-  creasing the Ar concentration to 4%, as shown in fig.  4B, there appears a second broad line whose center is  red-shifted by 212 cm-1. We believe the cluster re-  sponsible for this peak is M'^-Ar^. It is clear from the  relative intensities in fig. 4B, that the equilibrium is  shifting towards the production of the M'^'Ar^ cluster  at the expense ofM"'" and M^-Ax concentration. Fur-  ther addition of Ar (4-8%) to the expansion shifts  the production to even larger NT^-Ar^ clusters. We ob-  serve the formation of a 170 cm-1 broad peak whose  center continually red-shifts with increasing Ar con-  centration, reaching a maximum value at  470 cm~1.  W&amp; hav&amp; computer simulated this spectrum and find  that it is consistent with at least four distinct M^-Ax^  peaks of ^70 cm-1 width. Thus, the red-shifting of  the center is caused by changing of the relative con-  centrations of the M'^-Ar^ clusters for n = 3 6. The  shifts produced by each Ar atom addition is obviously  d fSeak t&amp; d se&amp; a. However, assaaaaig that th&amp; f&amp;ar  Ar atoms produce approximately equal shifts, then  one obtains an upper limit for the spectral shift of 70  cm-1 for 3 s n &lt;S 6. Above w8% Ar concentration; a  new trend occurs, with the entire spectrum shifting  towards the production of a new red-shifted peak at  249 cm-1, which we assign to M^Ar^ for n &gt; 6. This  peak shows a reversal in the spectral trend of red-  shifting with inert atom addition. We have also ob-  served this 249 cm-1 red-shifted peak in a pure Ar  expansion, and note that it is ahnost identical to the  matrix-gas shift recorded for CgFj^ in a solid Ar  matrix [ 14]. This is consistent with our view that the  final peak corresponds to a large cluster, n &gt; 6, which  exhibits properties very similar to those of a solid.    Table 1  The spectral shifts and linewidths of the C^F^-X^ clusters    4. Discussion    Table 1 summarizes the spectral shifts and line-  widths of the M4"-?^ clusters. The spectral red-shift  for M^X clusters increases, as expected, in the order  He &lt; Ne &lt; Ar. One would expect the ionic clusters to  be bound by a combination [15] of charge induced-  dipole and dispersive interactions, with the larger con-  tribution from the former. Both of these interactions  are proportional to the polarizability, a, of the inert  atom, but have different r dependences (r-4 and r~6,  respectively). Since the bond distance must increase  for the larger inert gases, one would expect a less than  linear increase with a in the binding energy, D, of the  complex and correspondingly a less than linear increase  in the spectral red-shift which represents the difference  in D in the two ionic states.    Recently, there has been a direct calculation [16]  of the binding energy for CgH^-Ne and CgH^-Ar.  While O! increases by more than a factor of 4 from Ne  to Ar, the calculated D values for the ground states  increase by only a factor of 2.4, compared to our ex-  perimental result of just under 2. No calculations  wee performed for CgH^-He, but older calculations  [15} for Na"1'-He, Na1'-Ne, and Na^Ar give a ratio m  the D values for Na"1" -Ar/Na"*" -Ne of 2.7, nearly the  same as the more detailed calculation for benzene cat-  ion clusters. Correspondingly, the theoretical Na"*"-Ne/  Na^He =15 and experimentally this same ratio is  observed for the red-shifts ofCgFp.Ne/CgF^-He.  These results are collected in table 2.    Evident in table 1, for the case of He and Ar clus-  ters, is the almost equal spectral shift produced by  the addition of the first two inert gas atoms, implying  nearly equivalent bonding sites. It is appealing to sug-  gest that the first two inert gas atoms are binding to  geometrically equivalent sites above and below the  benzene ring. Spectral evidence in the case of s-tetra-  zine [17] and benzene [18] complexes also shows        X Red -shi ft(c m-1)         Ar Matrix red-shifta)              (cm-1) (cm-1)  n = l n =2 n = 3 n = 4 n = 5 n = 6   n =     He 38 81 86        l    Ne 56 2 58  Ar 108 212 282  352  422  492 249 55 244  a) Ref.

The shift produced by addition of the third inert gas  atom is %  16% of the shift of the first two He atoms  and for Ar, we place an upper shift of ^60%. These  atoms probably go into a second "solvation sphere"  binding around the edge of the ring or to another inert  gas atom-  Table 1 also lists the linewidths, Av, of the M^X,,  clusters; there is a clear distinction between the line-  widths of the Ar clusters (55 cm"1) and those of He  or Ne (1 2 cm"1). The M^Ar cluster linewidth is in-  sensitive to various changes in experimental condi-  tions, inc tiding probing faither downstream and  operating the expansion at high backing pressures  with He gas as the main constituent. In fact. the line-  width here is consistent with the LIF linewidth found  for the M'^-Ar cluster m an electron bombardment  study [8]. These results indicate that the broad line-  widths of Ar clusters are not due to internal heating  by ion production but instead are likely an intrinsic  property of the molecular transition, as governed by  the operative Franck Condon factors.    We have previously noted that the Ar cluster spec-  trum was independent of the distance from the nozzle  to the PI region, which is correct for the observation  of the large Ar cluster peak, M'^-Ar^ for n &gt; 6. How-  ever, the ability to study the other ionic clusters adds  considerably more detail to the original observation-  In some cases, we observe a dependence of cluster  formation with nozzle PI region distance. A strong  dependence is seen in He, where we could spectrally  mimic the pressure dependent studies by varying the  distance between the nozzle PI region and a weak  dependence observed for Ar. Thus, we conclude that  some of the cluster formation is occurring after ioni-  zation and is dependent upon the collision frequency.    A further observation is that the overall efficiency  of ion production in the jet increases for the heavier  inert gas atoms. We believe that this is evidence for  preferential ionization of neutral cluster species com-  pared with neutral monomers. Under jet conditions  similar to ours, neutral clustering is prevalent [19].  Secondly, benzenoid compounds [20] exhibit a  strong absorption band that is coincident with the  ArF* laser transition at 193 nm. This absorption has  been recently shown to be inactive in the multi-  photon ionization spectra [21] of these species, sug-  gesting that it may lead to neutral fragmentation. In  a comptexed neutral, ejection of Ar stains might" tre-  a competitive path to fragmentation allowing the  neutral an opportunity to absorb a second ArF*  photon and ionize, giving rise to a distribution of  clustered and bare ions.    Finally, some discussion of the broad unassigned peaks  mentioned earlier m He and Ne expansion is appro-  priate. The peak blue-shifted by 14 cm"1 is present  in both He and Ne expansion but not present in Ar.  As the He or Ne stagnation is raised additional broad,  red-shifted, peaks appear, although the magnitude of  the shifts are different for He and Ne. We speculate  that the blue-shifted species in He and Ne maybe the  M^M dimer and the higher pressure red-shifted peaks  the M^M-X^ clusters. The failure to observe dimer  peaks in Ar could be because of competitive paths  favor a more efficient Ar complexing. The identifica-  tion of these peaks are obviously uncertain, but we  are presently applying mass spectroscopic techniques  to resolve this issue.    531    Volume 104, number 6    References    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    [1] DJL Levy, Ann.

Introduction    Extensive studies have been reported on the pho-  tophysics and photochemical isomerization reactions  of benzene and hexafluorobenzene (HFB) [1]. For-  mation of the so-called Dewar-type isomer is known  for HFB with a quantum yield of 0.08 by excitation  at 229 nm [2] . On the other hand, formation of the  Dewar isomer of benzene vapor has not been ob-  served. Fluorescence ofCF-, has recently been ob-  served for HFB vapor exdted by a KrF laser, where  the formation of a fulvene-type isomer has tentative-  ly been suggested as an intermediate for CF^ fluores-  cence [3] -    Small quantum yields of fluorescence (0.02) and  of intersystem crossing (0.05) have been observed  for HFB vapor with excitation close to the lowest  vibrational level ofSj [4]. The fluorescence lifetime  of HFB vapor {5] has been found to be very short  for 266 nm exdtation. These observations indicate  that the internal conversion to the ground electronic  state should take place very quickly in HFB with high  efficiency. Under these circumstances we have ap-  plied laser flash absorption spectroscopy with an ArF  laser to observe directly transient species.    Recently two of us studied the relaxation process  of the second excited singlet state, S^B^y), ofben-    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    zene by laser flash absorption spectroscopy and sug-  gested the formation ofvibrationally highly excited  ground-electronic-state benzene molecules, "hot ben-  zene", as the initial intermediate for fulvene isomer  [6] - Formation of hot molecules has also been re-  ported for UV light excitation of cydoheptatriene  [7] and azulene [8] . though experimental observa-  tion of hot molecules and information on their dy-  namical behaviour are still rare- In this paper we de-  scribe the formation of hot HFB molecules in rela-  tion to the photochemical reactions.    2. Experimental    Commercially available hexafluorobenzene with a  stated purity of&gt;99%was purified by trap-to-trap  distillation in vacuum. Nitrogen and oxygen pur-  chased from Nippon Sanso were used without further  purification. The stated purities of these gases were  N3 99.9985% and 03 99.99%.    The nanosecond laser photolysis apparatus has  been described [6]. HFB vapor was irradiated homo-  geneously with the output from a Lambda Physik  EMG 500 exdmer laser with a beam cross section of  0.5 cm X 3.5 4.2 cm. The typical energy in this ex-  periment was "=6.0 mJ/cm2 and at this fluence two-    533    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    photon excitation was negligible. The ArF laser line  at 193 nm corresponds to the peak of the fourth ab-  sorption band ofHFB,  B,y &lt;- ^ig [9] . The molar  extinction coefficient was measured to be 5160 cm-1  M"1 at 193 nm by a Cary 17 spectrophotometer.    The transient absorption intensity was normalized  with the laser output energy for every shot [6]. The  time resolution of the whole system was 12 ns. All  experiments were carried out at room temperature.    3. Results and discussion  3.1. Time-resolved absorption spectra    Observed time-resolved absorption spectra are  shown in fig. l (l Torr HFB), fig. 2 (l Torr HFB + 20          200    220    240    260    280    300  Wavelength /nm    Fig. i.

At the peak of the laser pulse (t = 0), HFB exhibits  quite similar absorption spectra regardless of the ab-  sence or presence of the foreign gas N^- Its intensity  decreases monotonically with increasing wavelength.  In the absence of nitrogen, the transient absorption  spectrum at shorter wavelengths than 220 nm in-  creases its intensity with time as illustrated m the os-  cilloscope trace (fig. la) inserted in fig. 1. At wave-  lengths longer than 220 nm, the transient absorption  decreases its intensity with time and reaches a con-  stant level at ' 2 lis after the laser pulse ( g. Ib), at  some wavelengths it holds the initial value or in-  creases slightly.    The decrease in the absorption intensity occurs at  around the peaks of absorption bands of "cool" HFB  molecules (unexdted molecule) and is mostly due to  the depletion of "cool" molecules. The laser light  pulse excites   10% of the HFB molecules in the la-  ser beam and produces "hot" molecules. The colli-  sional transfer of vibrational energy from "hot" rnole-    cules to "cool" unexdted HFB molecules decreases  the concentration of the "cool" HFB molecules. The  absorption spectrum at 2 lis exhibits absorption dips  at wavelengths corresponding to that of absorption  peaks (215,230,255 nm) of the "cool" molecules.  This process also decreases the average vibrational  internal energy of the "hot" molecules and induces  the decay of the absorption intensity at longer wave-  lengths than 220 nm.    Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the effect of added nitrogen  which is expected to act as the "coolant" for "hot"  HFB (HFB ). It decreases the vibrational energy of  HFB by collision, but it does not act as a quencher  of electronically excited HFB molecules. The colli-  sional deactivation by N^ addition, indeed, appears  after electronically excited HFB molecules have been  relaxed internally to some lower electronic state af-  ter a longer time interval than the fluorescence life-  time. The addition of oxygen, instead of nitrogen,  had a very similar effect on HFBt, as shown by the  oscilloscope trace in fig. 3c, though oxygen is known  as the effective quencher of electronically excited  singlet and/or triplet molecules. The apparent quench-  ing rate constants of nitrogen and oxygen for the  transient absorption at 205 nm are 1.6 and 1.5 X l O9  M~1 s~1, respectively [10]. This clearly indicates  that the structureless broad absorption spectrum is    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984        .15   -  .15 \V V- HFB: 1 Torr N^: 20 Torr   \ ^-  .15  ' = o J   - \ a^   o&gt;   .1 0 "N-\ 0  - ^0%&gt;0 ^-  -o.o, 0 ns. , . . l  0 \ ON,   JO  0 ,  o-o-o-o SQ ns  0inS 1 V0  o\ , , W,^ l l l l l.0-0-0-0 100 "s   .v "   .1 - o - 0 t i l l i l ~~i    \ \^?00^ 200 ns0 0 0 0-^^  .05 0 1111  ~r ?   - \ \ ^-o 400 ns  n  ^  III - - - - - -o~^^    15    .05    200    220    240    260    280    300  Wavelength / nm    Fig. 2.

The addition of high-pressure  N3 quickly decreases the vibrational energy ofHFB1  through collisions between HFBT and N7. Therefore,  in the presence of high-pressure N^ the depletion of  the "cool" HFB molecules is small and dips in the  transient absorption spectra are shallow compared  with those in the absence of nitrogen (figs. 1 and 3).  Immediately after the laser pulse, the concentration  ofHFB' , the concentration of molecules which ab-  sorbed the laser light, is ^ 10% of that of HFB. The  initial depletion of cool HFB absorbance, therefore,  is negligible. In the absence of nitrogen, however,  vibrational energy transfer between HFB1^ and cool  HFB molecules eventually elevates the temperature  of all the HFB molecules in the laser beam to ^700 K *  if no loss to the outside of the laser beam is assumed.    * The temperature rise of the sample is calculated using the  specific heat of hexafluorobenzene at constant volume  (Cy).

This effect accounts for the increase of absorbance  with time observed at wavelengths shorter than  220 nm, as shown in  g. l.    The final spectrum in fig. 1 should include the ab-  sorption by the photoproduct. The absorption profile  of the photoproduct is more distinct in figs. 2 and 3,  because the broad absorption by the "hot" HFB  (HFB1 ) molecules decays rapidly m the presence of  nitrogen. (In a previous paper [6], "hot" benzene  was described as B**(S()), but "hot" HFB is present-  ly expressed by HFB1^.) The photoproduct is ten-  tatively assigned to a fulvene-type isomer of HFB  since this absorption profile closely resembles that of  fulvene observed in the 193 nm photolysis of ben-  zene vapor with its strong peak at 240 nm (e = 1.4  X 104 M-1 cm-1 in cydohexane solution) [12].    535    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    3.2. Simulation of transient absorption spectra of  "hot"HFB    If an HFB molecule is in thermal equilibrium, the  internal vibrational energy of a molecule at a temper-  ature T(K), U^(T} is given by    30    U^(T) = S Af,/ [exp(A^7-)    I],    0)    where ff is the vibrational frequency of the fth vibra-  tional mode [13] . At room temperature (297 K),  molecules which absorb a light quantum at 193 nm  have internal energy -fin      EQ = hv(\ 93 nm) + u^(297 K) = 639 kJ/mol.   (2)    After internal conversion to the ground electronic  state, this internal energy is redistributed over various  vibrational modes of a molecule.    The assumption of complete thermal redistribu-  tion of this internal energy EQ over all vibrational  modes of an HFB molecule enables us to calculate  a hypothetical vibrational temperature T:    U^(T)=  -0=639 kJ/mol.                   (3)    The calculated vibrational temperature of an HFB  molecule excited at 193 nm using eq. (3) is 3050 K-    The spectral profile of the molar extinction coef-  ficient, e(v, T), at frequency v (cm~1 ) of HFB7 can  be simulated according to the treatment by Sulzer  and Wieland [14] for a single electronic transition  model,    e(v,T) = e^ A^expi-AB2) vIv^T),    ^(7-) = VQ -6(klhc)[exp(61T) - 1] -1,        (4)    where A = tanh (0/2 T),B = [y - VQ(T)} 1^, 6 a  characteristic temperature which corresponds to the    Table 1  Parameters for absorption spectra calculated at high temperatures        IU-^75 .^^  " s.o - \  -b ^ 25 \^fa.0  *0 . . , , 8ssa^.

An asymmetry and r-depen-  dent shift of the spectrum, vfvQ(T), is introduced  according to the modification by Astholz et al, [15].    The absorption spectrum e{y,T) at 3050 K has  been simulated using values ofe^^, VQ, and AI/Q list-  ed in table 1 and adjusting 6 to fit the experimental-  ly observed spectral profile of the absorbance at "r  = O". The spectrum thus simulated is shown in fig. 4,  together with observed transient absorption spectra  at "r = 0" between 205 and 300 nm. The extinction  coefficient at 230 nm of the observed absorption  spectra at "t = 0" have been determined by compari-  son with "hot" benzene, 3500   700 M-1 cm-1 [6].  Since 2.0 Torr benzene and 1.8 Ton- HFB at room  temperature have the same absorbance at 193 nm,  the transient absorbance for both samples observed  at "t = 0" and at the same wavelength can provide a    'max  (M-1 cm-i)    170 i  (cm-1)     ro  (cm-1)    e  (K)    T  (K)    HFB a)  benzene I')    47000  46300    57400  56200    1960  2400    135    275    3050  3390    a) Fig. 4.  tORef.I ].  536    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    proportional extinction coefficient when both sam-  ples are excited by an ArF 193 nm laser pulse. The  "t = 0" transient absorbances at 230 nm of benzene  (0.13) and HFB (0.11) have led to the value of the  extinction coef cient of HFB1" to be 3000   600 M-1  cm-^. This is in good agreement with the calculated  value of 2900 M-1 cm-1 at 230 nm from the simu-  lated absorption specturm, e(v, T), for 3050 K HFB.    Good agreement between e(v,T) at 3050 K and  the observed absorption spectra in fig. 4 indicates  that the absorption spectrum at "r = 0" is indeed due  to HFB^ and is mostly attributable to the transition  of ^u &lt;- lA^p in HFB, suggesting that the forbidden  transitions to ^^y and ^^u in D(^ symmetry spe-  cies are supposed to be very broad and weak in HFB'  and to be masked by the strong allowed transition  to ^ly. The absorption spectra of "hot" benzene  and "hot" toluene have been successfully analyzed  by a similar treatment though the treatment has  not been fully justified theoretically. Recently, some  modification of this treatment has been discussed by  Hippler et al. [7] but it still remains a semi-empirical  treatment.    The equivalent temperature T for HFB, 3050 K,  can explain the absorption spectrum of HFB^ ob-  served experimentally. This value is slightly lower  than that for benzene (3400 K). This difference is  due to the difference in the number of low-frequency  vibrational modes for HFB. The effective number of  vibrational modes (S^), calculated by the equation    s^:=u^'r&gt;^kT                             (5)  is 25 for HFB and 22 for benzene. The calculated  temperature T for these molecules provides a reason-  able explanation of the absorption spectra of hot  molecules. The low-frequency vibrational modes of  HFB accept efficiently the excitation energy. This  is one of the differences from the photophysical be-  haviour of benzene excited to the S^ state, though  we do not know at the present stage that it relates  to the difference in the photochemistries between  benzene and HFB.    Our present work has demonstrated that the ini-  tially observable intermediate is a hot HFB molecule.  These results allow us to analyze the collisional de-  activation of hot HFB molecules which certainly play  an important role in the photochemistry of HFB. De-  tailed results will be published elsewhere.    References    [I] C.S. Parmenter, Advan. Chem. Phys. 22 (1972) 365:    R.B. Cundall and S. McD. Ogilvie, in: Organic molecular  photophysics.

Introduction    The photofragmentation of alkyi iodides into an  alkyi radical and an iodine atom has been much stud-  ied recently. One parameter of particular interest  is the relative populations ofl(2p^,,) and l(^P^i^)  produced in the primary process. Such information,  especially when obtained as a function of wavelength  of absorption in the iodide, yields (a) theoretical  insight into the nature of the several absorption tran-  sitions present within the overall broad o* &lt;- n absorp-  tion band, and (b) data of consid rable practical im-  portance in the development of the iodine-atom laser  (2P3/2 &lt;- ^i/s) based on the photolytic break-up of  the parent iodide-    The branching ratio (^Pi/z/^a/z)ln slkyl iodide  photofragmentation has normally been measured using  absorption or emission characteristics of the two  atomic states [1]. However, in almost all such measure-  ments, absolute values have been difficult to determine  and values are normally reported relative to the branch-  ing ratio for n-CgF-yI, which has been taken to yield  exclusively the K2!*^) state (see below for details)  at all wavelengths within the o*   - n absorption band.  A quite different approach, using the optoacoustic  technique, has been developed to study these systems;    for each molecule at several chosen wavelengths the  branching ratio is measured absolutely. Results have  been reported for CH3l [2] and CH^Ia [3] and a paper  giving full experimental and analytical details has been    538    published on CHgI, CD^  and ?3! [4].    It was obviously of some interest to study opto-  acoustically the fragmentation in w-C^FyI. This paper  reports results at eight wavelengths within the broad  a* -&lt;- n transition.    Donohue and Wiesenfeld [5] found the yield q of  IC^l/a) i" "-C3F7I photolysis to be &gt; 0.99, using  broad-band flash photolysis followed by I-atom absorp-  tion. It is this work which led to the quantitative as-  sumption for q of unity for n-C^F-J , most other work  of a spectroscopic nature only claiming to measure  relative values for q. Koffend and Leone [6], using  fluorescence from the IC2?^) state, obtained rela-  tive values for q in n-C3F.7l at various wavelengths  between 250 and 330 nm- Within a fairly large error  of 10 15%, they found q to be independent of wave-  length [6] - However, they had used different pressures  ofw-CgF-y! for each wavelength measurement, and  subsequent work by Gerck [7] showed that exciplex  formation, Ki. ^P^n), was followed by exciplex  emission in very much the same wavelength regiou as  the atomic enussion.-The detectors used do not dis-  tinguish atomic and exciplex emissions and thus cor-  rection techniques are necessary before obtaining q  by this method. Smedley and Leone [8] have corrected  for this effect, and suggest q to be constant between  265 and 298 nm but to fall markedly at longer wave-  lengths. Gerck [9] has published data on several com-  pounds, correcting for excimer emission, but assumed  q to be unity for n-CyFfI at the wavelengths he used  (26o) and 308 nm).    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.

For n-C^P-J , values approaching unity  were obtained at both ends of the wavelength range  260-315 nm, with a minimum ofq= 0.78 at 285 nm.    Measurements of gain characteristics in alkyi iodide  photodissociation lasers, which l se on the F(4) -&lt;- F(3)  line of the K2?!;?) - -IC^ra) transition, have indi-  cated [12] output powers in the order    M-C3F7  &gt; ?3! &gt; CzFsI &gt; CH3I.    However, as we have already argued [4]. the output  power from such lasers is probably more dependent  on the position and width of the a*  &lt;- n absorption  band and on the rate ofdeactivation of H2?!;?) in the    system than on the detailed values of q provided, of  course, that these are large enough to enable lasing to  take place efficiently. This is supported by relative q  measurements on /2-C3F7  and C^FsI [9,13], which  indicate very similar q values for the two compounds-  It is clear from the above that to take n-C^F^  as  a marker molecule with q = 1 at all wavelengths in the  a*  (- n transition may not be justified- We report in  this paper values considerably below Unity-  2, Optoacoustic method    The general application of the optoacoustic tech-  nique to relaxation problems [14] and the details of  the method employed in studying photofragmentation  [4] have been given previously.    The primary process is    ii-C^F-Jl+hv-n-CyF-J (VJR,T)  +I(2Pl/2,7-)orI(2P3/2,^),    (0    where V, R and T refer to excess vibrational, rotation-  al energy respectively.    In the present experiments the pressure of M-C3F7I  used was around 1 Ton" and an excess pressure of  krypton (70 Torr) was added in each case. This was  for the following reasons:    (a) With this added ^as, vibrational and rotational  energy relaxation in the system were rapid on the  timescale of the measurements, and no optoacoustic  relaxation effects on amplitude or phase were present  due to these relaxations.    (b) Changes in the averaga mass of the gaseous sys-  tem, because of the concomitant velocity of sound  changes, can give rise to small changes in the phase of  the acoustic signal; the presence of the krypton keeps  the average mass effectively constant.    The major heat-yielding processes following the  photolysis are     -C3F7 (V.R,T) + M -* n-C3F7 + M + AE.     (2)  I(r)+M- I+M+A -,                     (3)  K^P^+M-K^^+M+Af.            (4)  M-C3F7 + I (or  -^-i-n-C^-J  (+1) + A \       (5)  I + I + (M, walls) -1^ (M. walls) + A -.         (6)    M indicates any collision partner present, i.e. krypton-  /I-C3F7.I or 12 (which develops a small concentration  in the photolysis cell).    As indicated, on the timescale of the measurement,  wich is determined by the frequency range (100 2500  Hz) of the incident radiation intensity modulation [4.  14], processes (2) and (3) are too fast to contribute  relaxation effects. It has also been shown (see ref. [4] )  that process (6) is too slow and can be ignored.    Both the processes (4) and (5) are found to con-  tribute optoacoustic phase lags in the measurement  region- There are thus three components contributing  to the observed signal; the fast energy flow of processes  (1) and (2) and two slow and independent processes,  (4) and (5). As previously shown [4]. the observed  optoacoustic phase lag, 0, in tlie measurement frequen-  cy region is given by    tan0 =    (Z.l/^)cos0i sin 0i +(L^IH) cos pi sin0;&gt;  1 + (L^IH) cos2 0i + (L-^IH) cos2 ^    (7)    where H is the exieni of energy flow in the fast pro-  cesses (1) and (2), 2.1 is the energy associated with  process (5) which shows a rate constant of 7-1'l. and  Z.2 is the energy involved in the relaxation of the  excited I atom, corresponding to process (4) with a  rate constant ofr^". ^i = tan~1 (UT^) and ^3 =  tan" 1 (0)1-2), where CL&gt; is the angular frequency (= 2irf)  of the intensity modulation of the photolysis radia-  tion.    From piots of Q against us, the four parameters  L^/H,T^,L^/ffand 73 can be found by suitable fit-    539    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    ting routines. For the measurement o!q, the quantum  yield ofl^P^) formation, the parameter of interest  isL-^IIf. The relationship [2,41 is given by    HIL-, =[(l-fl) (hv -D^s)  +q(hv-D^-E*)}lqE* ,    (8)    where hv is the energy of the absorbed photon, .D^og  is the dissociation energy at 298 K, and E* is the  I^Pj;?), (^3/3) energy gap. equivalent to 7603 cm~^.  Thus ~    (9)    and it is seen that an absolute method for obtaining  q is available with no need for comparisons or mea-  surement of absorption coefficients or radiation flux.  Any doubts about Htting the data to four unknowns can  be overcome by changing the parent iodide pressure;    this changes the amount of 13 produced in the system  and thus changes HfL i, TI and 7-3. H/L^ is, or course,  independent of such experimental changes and its val-  ues can therefore be obtained and checked.    Analysis of the chemical process, such as (5), in  terms of T^ and Hit, ^ has been carried out and the  optoacoustic procedure for studying chemical reac-  tions discussed [15].    3. Experimental    Full experimental details have been given pre-  viously [4]. The source is a super-pressure Hg arc plus  high-intensity monochromator; the eight excitation  wavelengths used are centred at 247.4,251.5,274.0,  280.5,287.5,296.0, 301.5 and 312.5 nm. A typical  half-intensity bandwidth is ^l 50 cm"1 ; see r f. [4]  for individual widths. The spectrophone cell has a  specially constructed smooth interior shape [16] to  avoid spurious resonances. Intensity modulation was  achieved by direct modulation of the lamp output  [4] and the useful range was 100 2500 Hz. Phase-  sensitive detection gave adequate signal-to-noise ratios  and, in general, phase measurements are accurate to ^  .  Wtier&amp; this. is. not tti&amp; case due t&amp; low signal levels, tb&amp;  higher errors will be indicated- Calibration of the sys-  tem with totally relaxed gaseous systems has been    carried out extensively [4,16,17].    This gases used were krypton (BOC Research Grade,    i o    540    99.99%) andw-C3F7l (Aldrich 99%, further purified  and outgassed by repeated distillation cycles).    4. Results and discussion    Measurements of the acoustic phase lag due to pro-  cesses (4) and (5) were carried out as a function of  modulation frequency, a;. Examples forn-C3F7l are  given in fig. 1. The slower process, i.e. (5), showed a  maximum phase lag in such plots which was always  between 10 and 20 times lower in frequency than the  maximum associated with the excited atom deactiva-  tion, i.e. (4). Because of the nature of the combined  phase plot, individual maxima may not show clearly  but are readily analysed using eq. (7). This was exact-  ly as found [4] for similar measurements on CFgI; in  both cases, H^i/z) is being deactivated by L) pro-  duced in the photolysis system at pressures of the or-  der of 10~4 to 10~3 Torr [15]. The case for assigning  the faster process to I(Pi/2) deactivation has been  made previously [2,4].    -ff/Z.2 values were obtained at the eight wavelengths  given in table 1. For almost all wavelengths, checking  measurements were made at different pressures of 13    9/deg.          1 /kHz    Fig- 1.

In such  checking experiments, HIL 2 should remain the same  and was indeed found to do so within an error of bet-  ter than 10%. Average values are given in table 1 where  the concomitant values ofq, calculated using eq. (9),  are also shown. The values are obviously well down  on those measured or assumed in other work; they are  in fact very similar to those previously measured opto-  acoustically for CF3l [4], being somewhat lower at  the low-wavelength end of the range and, within ex-  perimental error, the same throughout the rest of the  range. The maximum of the absorption curve (o*  f- n)  for n -C3F7I is only some 3 nm to higher wavelength  than in ?3!. Values ofq for CF^ , Ctl^  and CD^   are included in table 1.    The general validity of the optoacoustic method is  backed up by two other types of results:    (a) The rate constants measured for deactivation  of^Pi/s) by CH3l [2], by CD^  [4] and by CH^  [3] are all in very good agreement with the latest re-  sult using emission techniques.    (b) Preliminary results on C^fl^l,n-C^  -J  and  i-CgH^I [18] and more detailed results on these mol-  ecules to be published [19] showed smaller values for  q for the first two molecules and essentially zero q for  the- last. The- samasr values obtained for CH^I, CE^I,  CF3l and M-C3F7  are thus not due to some overall  restrictive experimental factor.    Therefore, the results forw-C3F7l should be valid  within the stated experimental error.    The accuracy is not dependent on any comparison,  on absorption coefficients or on radiation intensities,  but is dependent on the factors expressed in eq. (9):    (a) The magnitude of the energy of the absorbed  photon, hv, is not exact, typical excitation bandwidths  [4] being around 150 cm~1 - Calculations involving  deconvolution of the excitation bandwidth with the  absorption profile showed that any error from this  source is much less than the quoted error.    (b) The value for-D^gg for/i-C3F7l was taken as  49.8   1.0 kcal mol-1 [20], which is equivalent to  17420   350 cm-1. An error of around 270 is thus  introduced.    (c) E*, at the equivalent of 7603 cm"1, is known  with high accuracy.    (d) The only parameter left in eq. (9) is the experi-  mentally determined H/L -&gt;. The accuracy of this pa-  rameter reflects the accuracy in the measured phase  lag which in turn depends on signal size, the absolute  value of the phase lag and the extent of overlap with  the process (5) signal. The errors quoted show our es-  timate of the phase-lag accuracy with the errors from  sources (a) and (b) above added in.    Comparison with the results from absorption and  emission techniques are difficult on an absolute basis  since only Donohue and Wiesenfeld [5], with broad-  band excitation, give an absolute value ofc&gt; 0.99.  However, relative values have been much reported.  Gerck [9], using atomic emission with correction for  exciplex formation, measured q values of 0.75 (248  nm) and 0-83 (308 nm) for CF3l relative to assumed  values of unity at both wavelengths for K-C3F7L    541    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    Smedley and Leone [8], using a quantitatively different  correction for exciplex emission, found that q for  n-C3F7  (308 nm) was down to 0.82 relative to as-  sumed values of unity at lower wavelength. A new  method by Brewer et al. [21], involving laser-induced  vacuum-ultraviolet fluorescence, has given results not  on n-C3F7  but on C^I, CD^l and ?3! at 248 nm.  They take q (CH3I) as 0.76 and by comparison get  0.75 for CD3l and 0.89 for CF3l. Taken as relative  values these are not far from our own results (table 1).  The broadband excitation ofDonohue and Wiesenfeld  [5] gave 0.92 ((^I), 0.99 (?3!) and 0-90 (CF3 )  for these three compounds. Sufficient differences exist  between these results to suggest that no clear-cut result  from emission and absorption data can be assumed.    As mentioned in section 1, using the output powers  from iodide lasers is not particularly helpful in assessing  relative q values. For example, the finding [12] that  the order of output powers is n-C3F7l &gt; ?3! &gt;  0^51 is not in line with the measurement [9] ofq for   ^5! being somewhat higher than that forra-C3F7l  at both 248 and 308 nm. Laser output will depend on  a variety of factors: (a) q values, (b) rate ofdeactivation  of^2?!^) in the system, and, perhaps most impor-  tantly, (c) if the laser is flashlarnp-pumped the overlap  of the lamp output profile with the absorption spec-  trum. This last factor may well favour strongly those  iodides whose absorption is to longest wavelengths  (cf. fig. 2).    Turning to the implications of these results on the  position and strength of the sub-bands within the a*   *- n envelope, the strong spin orbit coupling model  [2,4] suggests the excited state is split into five com-  ponents for C3y symmetry. These are A\, A^, E, E  and E with the ground state as AI . Three transitions  have been observed from the analysis of the branching  ratio data [2,4] and also, for C i^  [22], from MCD  results. These correspond to E.E &lt;- AI (3E), A^  &lt;- AI  and E  &lt;- AI ^E), the excited states shown in brackets  being the correlated weak spin orbit coupled states.  In Mulliken notation, these are 3Qo, ^i and 1Q^  respectively. For n-C3F7  the difference in symmetry  does not appear to change the analysis into three sub-  bands (see below), a result also obtained by Smedley  and Leone [8].    In our previous discussion [4] ofCHsI, CD^  and  CFtI we chose to concentrate on relative effects,    taking the peak absorption coefficient as 310 dm3    542          30000    35000       AOOOO  ._-)    Fig. 2.

The marked difference of  the F-containing and H-containing compounds in the  shape of the I(2P3/2) formation with wavelength is  obvious.    The method for analysis into sub-bands (see r f. [4]  for details) is as follows. It is assumed (cf. work on  CH^I^ [3]) that the main A^ &lt;- AI transition, as well  as showing its ^^ Peak as in ^8- 2, is also present in  the 2P3/2 curve of fig- 3 due to curve crossing. The  maximum possible contribution tc the ^3/2 curve  from the A^ &lt;- AJ transition is then calculated.

Using this maximum contribution,  their shapes turn out to be essentially gaussian, but no  gaussian profiles have been imposed. If much lower  values of the curve-crossing ratios are used, these two  transitions (E,E  &lt;- A^E) and E f- A^E)) are ex-  tremely distorted and non-symmetrical in energy. The  results of such calculations for the four molecules are  given in table 2, where peak positions, intensities, half-  intensity bandwidths and curve-crossing ratios are  given.    The substitution of H atoms by F atoms in these  molecules brings about three main changes: (i) the A'j'   t- AI transition strength is lowered by some 30%, (ii)  the E   - AI^E) transition strength is lowered by a  factor of 2, and (iii) the E,E -&lt;- A^E) transition  strength is increased by a factor of approximately 4.    5. Conclusion    The main result of this note is on the yield ofI^P^;^)  in n-C^F-fl photodissociation. This molecule has in  the past been taken as a calibrant for such yields, q,  with an assumed value of unity at all wavelengths. The  present results indicate values much less than unity in    the wavelength range 247.5 312.5 nm, and indeed    the q values are close to those measured [4] for CFsI.  Taking absolute absorption coefficients, the q results  fbrH-CgF-yI are used to compare the positions and  strengths of the sub-bands in the a*  *- n envelope  with results for CH^ , CD^  and CF^ .    Theoretical models are not easy to fit to the range  of results, and perhaps the most pertinent comment  is that ofDonohue and Wiesenfeld [5] on the role of  R'T" in the excited-state configuration. There is, in  fact, a rough correlation between the ionization po-  tential of the alkyi radical and the q value. Thus, for  example, for CH3 the IP is 9.84 eV (for ?3,9.83 eV)  and reduces, through C^H^ and n -C^H-J, to I-C-^H-J  at 7.52 eV; the q values decrease in this order. For  the present results it is of interest to note that CFg  and n-C^F-J have- similar IP values at 10.10 and  10.06 eV respectively, and that these values are quite  close to the quoted values for CHg and CD-y.

SEDER and Eric WEITZ *  Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60201, USA    Received 28 July 1983; in final form 5 December 1983    The multiple-photon absorption behavior of a series ofalkyi chlorides and a number of hexadiene isomers has been  examined in order to elucidate the dependence of absorption cross section on fluence. Measurements of absorbed energy  via a photoacoustic technique show that, while a high density of states is necessary for an absorption cross section linear  in fluence, other factors are also important. A photoacoustic technique for measuring absorbed energy by weakly absorb-  ing molecules at low pressure is described.    1. Introduction    Infrared multiple photon absorption processes  have received an enormous amount of attention over  the last decade. To describe the absorption of multiple  photons by a molecule interacting with intense infra-  red radiation, generally accepted models group molec-  ular vibrational states into three regions and treat the  interaction of the field with each region more or less  separately ll,2]. Absorption in the first region of dis-  crete states requires invoking mechanisms to compen-  sate for state-to-state anhannonicity. Rotational state  compensation [3], level splitting due to rotation vi-  bration interactions and power broadening, the most  often invoked mechanisms, are important in the ab-  sorption process in the discrete region. Discrete re-  gion absorption proceeds until the molecular energy  content is such that the density of states is suf cient-  ly large for absorption to continue without the assis-  tance of the above mechanisms. Absorption in this,  the second region, is fluence dependent and incohe-  rent; oscillator strength for absorption exists at vir-  tually all frequencies. Region three corresponds to  the continuum of energy levels above the decomposi-  tion threshold. Absorption in this region can be in-    * At&amp;ed P.

In region two, the quasi-continuum, the popula-  tion distribution resulting from absorption of infra-  red radiation can be determined using a master equa-  tion obtained via reduction of the Schrodinger equa-  tion to a set of coupled linear rate equations [4]. For  many systems, particularly medium to large organic  molecules, it has been found that a master equation  approach can be used to successfully model reaction  yields [5]. To successfully use a master equation to  predict yields following multiple photon absorption,  it must be clear that the effects of discrete region ab-  sorption can be neglected. In addition, energy depen-  dent absorption cross sections, a(E}, must be supplied  as an input.    How the absorption coefficient depends on the in-  ternal energy of the molecule potentially involves a  variety of factors. If a bottleneck to up-pumping  exists in the discrete region, as might be expected for  a small molecule, a(E) would be expected to decrease  at least until the quasi-continuum is reached. Large  molecules possess a significant vibrational heat capaci-  ty and have a rapidly increasing density of states;    thus, they may be in or near the quasi-continuum fol-  lowing the absorption of the first photon. Under  th';se circumstances, a bottleneck in the absorption  process would not be expected, but it is still not ap-    545    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    parent what form c(E) would take. However, in a  number of large molecules it has been shown that ab-  sorbed energy is a linear function of fluence, implying  that b( ) does not strongly depend on internal energy    16].    In an effort to learn more about the form of a( )  and to elucidate the connection between a(E) and the  density of molecular states, we have examined, via a  photoacoustic technique, the dependence of absorbed  energy on laser fluence for a series of alkyi chlorides  (methyl through butyl), where the density of states  is increased by successive addition of m thyl ne  groups. We have also investigated the multiphoton ab-  sorption behavior of a number of large molecules;    various isomers of the conjugated hexadienes.    The photoacoustic technique that was used is in-  trinsically very sensitive to absorbed energy. However.  previously existing procedures for both the quantita-  tive and qualitative determination of absorbed energy  are not clearly defined and are unstandardized. A cell  calibration method is discussed which allows for both  quantitative and qualitative determination of adsorb-  ed energy via photoacoustic measurements.    2. Experimental    AU of the compounds studied were excited by the  collimated (0.32 cm2 cross-sectional area), unfocused  output of a Lumonics K203-2 TEA laser. The output  pulse consisted of a gain switched spike of' 60 ns  (fwhm) containing approximately 50% of the pulse  energy followed by a s ! .2 ps (fw) tail. Laser fluence  was varied from 0.2 to 4.0 J/cm by passing the beam  through a gas cell filled with a variable pressure of  propylene.    The non-resonant brass photoacoustic (PA) cell  had an overall length of 23 cm and a radius of 2.5 cm.  AKnowles BT-1759 electret microphone was cen-  trally mounted 1.2 cm from the long axis of the cell.  The microphone response was measured to be linear  to 8 V (peak to peak) when the microphone integral  amplifier combination was biased to 15 V. Baffles  3 cm ill length and having a 2 cm diameter aperture  were positioned beginning 2.5 cm from the micro-  phone. These baffles helped isolate the microphone  from acoustic signals generated by window absorp-  tions. Background signals, measured both with the    546    cell evacuated and filled with 100 Torr rL&gt;, were  insignificant. The microphone output was amplified,  recorded by a Biomation 61 OB transient recorded,  displayed on an oscilloscope, and subsequently plot-  ted using a Y  T chart recorder.    The above procedure provides a method for deter-  mining relative energy absorbed for a system with a  given molar heat capacity, Cy. To relate the energy  absorbed by a system with a given Cy to that absorb-  ed by a system with a different Cy, the equation [7]    (l)    can be used. PA. is the measured photoacoustic sig-  nal, P is the pressure,  'ai,s ls ^le ^sorbed energy and  AT is a constant specific to the cell and microphone  combination. For quantitative use of photoacoustic  measurements, K must be determined. This was done  by the use of eq. (1) to relate the energy absorbed  by cfs-1,3-hexadiene, measured calorimetrically, to  the magnitude of photoacoustic signals. C s-l,3-hexa-  diene was chosen because, over the range of conditions  used in the reported experiment, its absorption cross  section was both fluence and pressure independent.  The actual determination of K was achieved by extra-  polating the results of high pressure (2 8 Torr) calo-  rimetric measurements to low pressure and comparing  them with low-pressure photoacoustic rneasurements-    Direct calorimetric determination of the energy  absorbed by ris-l,3-hexadiene was performed via  measurement of energy transmitted through a 43 cm  glass absorption cell containing a desired pressure of  compound, to that transmitted when the cell was  evacuated. Transmitted energy was measured with a  calibrated Scientech disk calorimeter. Pulse-to-pulse  variations in laser energy were ^10%.    All reported PA data are from single pulse measure-  ments. Single pulse fluence measurements were made  with a pyroelectric detector whose active area  sampled a portion of the excitation pulse that was re-  flected from a 1 mm thick BaF^ beam sputter placed  at near normal incidence to the beam. The pyroelec-  tric detector was calibrated in a given geometry by  simultaneous use of the disk calorimeter to measure  energy traasrotted by the beam splitter.    At the experimental pressures and fluences, no  alkyi chloride dissociation products were detected by  gas chrornatography. No dissociation of the hexadiene  isomers was observed, however isomerization does oc-    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    cur within the range of fluences used. Isomerization  yields per pulse are low, isomerization is nearly ther-  moneutral [8], and all curves were constructed by  specifically avoiding systematic fluence variations  so that systematic errors in absorption measurements  did not occur due to isomerization of the parent.    3. Results and discussion    The microphone response to the acoustic impulse  generated via vibrational relaxation subsequent to  the multiple photon absorption process resembles a  damped sine wave- A variety of procedures have been  used to designate a "photoacoustic signal". The peak-  to-trough height of the first cycle [9], the integrated  area of the first half cycle [10] and the height of the  first peak [11] have all been used as a measure of ab-  sorbed energy- In addition, care has often not been  taken to be sure that vibrational relaxation is com-  plete on the time scale of the microphone response.    We have found that the height of the first peak is  most indicative of absorbed energy for molecules  whose vibrational relaxation time is significantly          1.0     20     30     40  Pressure (Torr)    Fig. l.

This re-  quirement on relaxation times was imposed after not-  ing a strong correlation between peak trough asym-  metry and the rate of vibrational relaxation in a sys-  tem. This is illustrated in fig. 1 where the peak height  (P) divided by the sum of the peak plus trough height  (P + T) is plotted versus pressure for two gases and  two mixtures of gases. In the case of gas mixtures, the  added gas was a non-absorber and efficient relaxer  of the absorber [12]- In each case as the vibrational  relaxation time decreased, Pf(P + T) approached 0.5.  Additionally, most of the change in P/(P + T) was due  to a change in the size and shape of the second half  of the first sine wave, the trough. Neither microphone  bias voltage or slight alteration of cell alignment had  any effect on peak trough asymmetry. Geometric  considerations ruled out the possibility of acoustic  interferences as the major source of the observed  asymmetry.    A que'itative understanding of peak versus trough  amplitudes can be obtained by considering the har-    monic response of the microphone to impulses of  varying duration. If the duration of the impulse is  short compared to the natural period of the micro-  phone diaphragm, as would be expected for rapidly  relaxing systems, then the response of the microphone  will approximate the response to a S function impulse  and it will oscillate at its natural frequency. Under  these circumstances, neglecting damping and acoustic  reflections, the peak and trough will be symmetric.  As the duration of the impulse increases, the micro-  phone response becomes more complex. The micro-  phone response must be convoluted with a non-delta-  function impulse. A simplified view is that the trough  of the wave generated by the leading edge of the im-  pulse will interfere with the peak of the wave gener-  ated by the tail of the impulse. This will result in  peak trough asymmetries such as observed in fig- 1-  Referring to fig. 1, the calculated relaxation times for  1 and 3 Torr ofCHgCl are 130 and 43 fis respectively  [13]. The natural period of the microphone is 75 ps.  It is evident that the shorter relaxation time produces  a more symmetric response.    Th&amp; above discussion also implies   ia    is peak of  the first sine wave may be a function of the magnitude  of the acoustic impulse. This effect is minimized in  rapidly relaxing systems but would explain why a  dependence of peak trough asymmetry on input    547    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    energy, is observed to be significant in more slowly re-  laxing systems. Thus rapid vibrational relaxation is re-  quired for quantitative use of photoacoustic data.  The first peak of a photoacoustic signal is a better  criterion of absorbed energy than peak  trough height  but care in use of the data must be exercised in slow-  ly relaxing systems. In all data reported in this paper,  the height of the first peak is reported and care was  exercised to keep relaxation times faster than the  microphone's natural response time. Where experi-  mental data did not exist, relaxation times were es-  timated via empirical correlations [12].    The dependence of absorbed energy in methyl  chloride is plotted versus laser fluence in fig. 2. Hy-  drogen has been added to methyl chloride to increase  the rate of relaxation of the mixture [13]- It is ap-  parent that methyl chloride exhibits a highly fluence          10      15     2.0     25      SO     35  Fluence (-J/cm2)    Fig. 2. The normalized photoacoustic signal for the alkyi  chlorides is plotted versus fluence. The photoacoustic signal  has been normalized by multiplication by the heat capacity  of the compounds (mixture) studied- The average number of  absorbed photons, &lt;n&gt;, can be determined by dividing the  normalized signal by 2.6 X 1023 X energy of photon in  .  joules X the pressure in ton.    548    dependent absorption cross section. This behavior is  found to be independent of parent pressure over the  range 0.6-1.0 Torr ofCH^CL The total pressure of  the mixture scaled with the CHgCl pressure. That  CH3C1 exhibits saturative absorption, i.e. the absorp-  tion cross section decreases with increasing internal  energy, may indicate the presence of a discrete region  bottleneck.    Addition of a m thyl ne group to CH^Cl dramatic-  ally diminishes the nonlinearity in absorbed energy  versus fluence (fig. 2). Ethyl chloride (EtCl) exhibits  a slight change in slope (initial and final slopes rough-  ly differ by a factor of 2) of the absorbed energy ver-  sus fluence curve upon excitation within the R branch  at 983 cm"1 (fig. 3), or the blue edge of the P branch  at 966 cm"- - A linear absorbed energy versus fluence  curve is obtained for excitation within the red edge of  the EtCl P branch at 951 cm~1 (fig. 3). This behavior  is consistent with an absorption mechanism involving  sequential absorption in the P Q R branches com-  pensating for the anharmonicity of the pumped mode;    rotational compensation.

The photoacoustic signal (in mV) is plotted versus  fluence for 1.00 Torr of ethyl chloride excited at the indicat-  ed frequencies.    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    sorption coefficient versus frequency are also com-  patible with a red-shifting of the multiple photon ab-  sorption spectrum which has been seen in other small  molecules [14,15]. As with CHgCl, there was no ob-  served dependence on pressure over the range 0.4 1.0  Torr. These observations are also qualitatively com-  patible with dissociation yield measurements [16].    As the density of the states is increased via addi-  tion of more m thyl ne groups, a linear absorption  coefficient versus fluence is approached, n-propyi  chloride shows some evidence of saturative absorp-  tion at low fluence (fig. 2). However, n-butyl chloride  is linear with fluence over the experimentally observ-  ed range (fig. 2). From these results, it is tempting to  speculate that as the energy at which the onset of the  quasi-continuum occurs decreases, absorbed energy  versus fluence curves become more linear- For example,  for EtCl, the state density is 100/cm"1, the criterion  commonly used for the onset of the quasi-continuum,     -1    -1    at  5800 cm"1. In PrCl, 100 states/cm"1 occurs at  ^3500 cm"1 while in BuCl this occurs at ==2800  cm"1. Taking into account the vibrational heat ca-  pacities ofpropyi and butyl chloride, of 20.3 and 26-1  cal/mole K respectively, it appears that at room tem-  perature, propyi chloride is almost in the quasi-con-  tinuum following absorption of a 10 fim photon and  butyl chloride is m the quasi-continuum following ab-  sorption of a 10 iim photon.    From these observations it would be predicted  that the conjugated hexadiene isomers with a greater  vibrational heat capacity and a larger state density  would be expected to give a purely linear absorbed  energy versus fluence curve.    As seen in fig. 4 this is not what is observed- Linear  absorption is observed for ci -l,3-hexadiene over the  fluence range studied, however, saturative behavior is  observed for both trans,trans-2,4- and cis,trans-'2,4-  hexadiene. It should also be noted that all curvature  in the absorbed energy versus fluence curve disappears  at higher pressure (&lt;6 Torr). Interestingly this type  of saturative behavior appears to be rather different  in nature than that observed in the alkyi chloride  series. For the alkyi chlorides nonlinearity manifests  itself as a low fluence shoulder in the absorption curve.  It the absorbed energy versus fluence curves of the  cis,trans- and rrans,frans-2,4-hexadienes, nonlinearity  gradually appears at higher fluences. Further, in the  case of the hexadienes, curvature is evident through-          1.0       15      20      25      30    Fluence (J/cm2)    Fig. 4.

The average number of absorbed photons can  be determined from these data by use of eq. (1) in the text  w ihK = 2.6 X 1023 mV cal/J mole K Torr.    out the high fluence range; whereas for the alkyi  chlorides, the high fluence portion of the absorbed  energy versus fluence curves is linear. This type of be-  havior suggests that the observed changes m the prob-  ability of absorption by the hexadienes are not due to  processes occurring in or near the discrete region. In-  deed, the relatively large state density and vibrational  heat capacity implies the hexadienes are in the quasi-  continuum with absorption of a single photon. This,  taken in conjunction with the large energy content of  the hexadienes (6 18 phoions per molecule for  trans.trans-2,4) in the region of curvature, forces us  to look for a different explanation for this lack of  linearity.    A potential explanation involves the "heat-bath feed-  back model" [17.18]. In this model it is postulated that  the coupling of the pumped mode to the other vibra-  tional states, the bath states, is sensitive to the nature    549    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    of both the pumped mode and the bath states in the  energy regime in which the up-pumping rate is equal    to the rate of energy transfer to the heat bath states.  Within the context of this model, curvature in the ab-  sorbed energy versus fluence curves could be explained  by the differences in mode mode coupling as a function  of energy content of the pumped mode. As fluence  increases, the rate of up-pumping increases and the en-  ergy content of the molecule increases. This could then  lead to a different "spill-over" point between the pump-  ed mode and the heat bath- The differences in behavior  between the 2,4- and 1,3-hexad enes could be postulat-  ed to be due to differences in coupling of the relevant  modes as a consequence of the rigidity of the molecular  framework. The 2,4-hexadienes would be expected to  be more rigid molecules with less internal rotation  than the 1,3-hexadienes- This could plausibly mani-  fest itself as a more efficient coupling between pump-  ed mode and heat-bath states. Collisions could en-  hance this coupling in the 2,4-hexadienes and remove  the observed nonlinearities at higher pressure. Though  the predictions of this model are compatible with ob-  served behavior, it is questionable whether timescales  for V V transfer between modes are compatible with  the application of this model to the systems under  study.    An interesting modification of the "heat-bath  feedback model" occurs if the limiting step in the ab-  sorption process is the 0 -   1 vibrational transition.  Under these circumstances it is easy to explain why  the absorption coefficient for multiple photon ab-  sorption in large molecules extrapolates to the 0 - -1  absorption cross section. Absorption on the 0 -&gt; 1  vibrational transition could be rate limiting if the rate  of intramolecular energy transfer out of   = 1 mode  was greater than the up-pumping rate. In this situa-  tion, energy would be funneled into the heat bath  through the   = 1 state with each successive photon  absorbed repopulating u = 1. Since for molecules like  the hexadienes, u = 1 is in the quasi-continuum, it is  - not implausible that rates of intramolecular energy  transfer are fast enough to accomplish this process.  This explanation is attractive in that it easily explains  the observed magnitude of the absorption cross sec-  tion. In addition, it could also explain the curvature  in the absorbed energy versus fluence curves. As the  vibrational energy content of the molecule increases,.  its vibrational temperature increases and the popula-    550                                   .    tion ratio for u = l fv = 0 increases. This results in a  diminished absorption cross section; a "vibrational    saturation" effect which should be present in all high-  ly excited systems. If the absorbed energy versus -  fluence curves for trans,tmns- and Cts,frffns-2,4-hexa-  diene are modified to account for this effect, the  curves will approach a straight line. For the cu-1,3-  hexadiene it is found that its energy content is not  high enough for a significant correction to be warrant-  ed and its absorbed energy versus fluence curve re-  mains a straight line. This explanation is an enticing  one. However, within this simple model it is not ob-  vious how the tendency of the energy versus fluence  curve toward linearity at high parent pressure can be  explained.    Thus, though a "vibrational saturation" effect  should occur in all highly excited systems, we con-  clude that a simple model such as that discussed  above is not adequate to explain all experimental ob-  servations. It is however apparent that the nature of  the saturative behavior observed in the hexadiene is  different than that observed in the alkyi chlorides and    in the hexadienes it clearly involves changes in the ab-  sorption cross section, and/or energy transfer dynam-  ics that occur in the quasi-continuum. Thus a high  density of vibrational states is not a sufficient condi-  tion for a linear absorption curve.    4. Conclusions    The use of a photoacoustic probe of absorbed ener-  gy is most reliable when the height of the first acous-  tically generated peak is designated as the "PA signal".  A photoacoustic probe is best used when the vibra-  tional relaxation time of the system is significantly  faster than the acoustic response of the system-    With a photoacoustic probe, we have investigated  multiple photon absorption in a series of alkyi chlor-  ides and hexadiene isomers. For the alkyi chlorides a  discrete region bottleneck is seen for the lowest mem-  ber of the series, CHgCl. For EtCl a bottleneck is also  observed which can be mitigated by up-pumping on  the red edge of the absorption curve. PrCl exhibits  slight saturation behavior and BuCl does not exhibit  saturative. behavior.-This is likely a consequence of  the increased heat capacity and higher density of  states of these molecules, with the conclusion that at    Volume 104, number 6 CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS 24 February 1984    least BuCl is in the quasi-continuum following absorp-  tion of a single photon.    The 2,4-hexadienes also exhibit a non-linear absorb-  ed energy versus fluence curve. However, deviations  from linearity are very different in nature from that  observed in the case of the alkyi chlorides. For the  hexadienes, deviations occur at much higher levels of  excitation than for the alkyi chlorides. Possible  sources of this effect are discussed with reference to  a variety of factors which can contribute to this be-  havior-  Acknowledgement    We would like to thank the National Science Foun-  dation for support of this work under grant No. CHE82-  06976.

Introduction    Following the pioneering work of Mims [1 ], tran-  sient ESR experiments are well established and applied  to a wide variety of research [2]. Applications to the  study of excited molecular triplet states are more re-  cent, and include the use of spin coherence phenom-  ena [3} or exploitation of spectroscopic information  contained in the electron spin echo envelope modula-  tion (ESEEM) [4-9].    The electron spin echo (ESE) technique is also suit-  ed to the investigation of the complete kinetics of  triplet states (see, for example, r f. [8]), including  the parameters of electronic population and decay as  well as. their spin selectivity and spin relaxation. Coso-  plete kinetic parameters of triplet states have only  been obtained at very low temperatures, mainly with  ODMR techniques. As high temperatures are usually  associated with predominantly non-radiative decay,  alternative methods such as ESE are necessary.    * P essst a   ess: Physikalisches  a  itat 2, Vswfssa&amp;t Stutt-  gart, D-7000 Stuttgart 80; Federal Republic of Germany.    It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate the  potential of ESE for determining the complete ki-  netics of photoexcited triplet states. Sp cifie applica-  tion has been made to the excited triplet state of acri-  dine doped in single crystals of fluorene, this state ex-  hibiting a thermally activated, non-radiative decay  channel at higher temperatures which has recently  been identified as the pathway of the photochemical  reaction resulting in hydrogen abstraction by the ac-  ceptor acridine in its T^ (^ir*) state from the donor  fluorene [10 14]. ESE can contribute the detailed  parameters of this non-radiative triplet decay, and in  particular its spin selectivity, which will be shown to  be consistent with the proposed reaction mechanism.    552    2. Theoretical aspects    After an initial excitation to triplet states, for  example by a laser pulse, the population distribution  over the triplet spin states may be described by the  general equation    aNldt=-KN-WN.

We shall use here the following extreme con-  ditions which lead to quite trivial solutions of eq. (I):    (a) High external magnetic field. In order of de-  creasing energy, the triplet spin levels 1, 2, 3 become  the Zeeman levels +, 0,  , withN^ O) =N^(0) and  &amp;l=fc3.    (b)High temperature. The ratio of the "up" and  "down" relaxation rates    wc/^- = exp(-\AEy\/kT)    (2)    is approximated by w - s  w .    Under these conditions, the initial condition A^ (0)  = Ni(0) (ie. equal population of the outer Zeeman  levels) is maintained at all times: Ni(t) == N^(t). N^  orN^ can be eliminated from the rate equations and   we are left  with two-level rate equations for the level  pairs (1,2) or (2, 3) relevant for lAml = 1 ESR tran-  sitions:    dA^/dr = -(w + k^)N^ + wN-i,    (3a)     N^f t = 2wN^ - (2w + k^)N^.              (3b)  The corresponding equations for the level pair (2, 3)    can be obtained by replacing index 1 by 3. Only a  single (lAm| = 1) relaxation rate w remains to be con-  sidered.

(2). For the  case of fast relaxation (w     :), this result can be  modified to include the actual relaxation towards  Boltzmann equilibrium. For sufficiently long times  the populations N, will then be determined by the  Boltzmann distribution, independent of time:    NilNj = exp(-A y/AD,  E^ &gt; E-^ &gt;   3.    For a fixed energy separation 5, one obtains for the  relevant population differences in the linear high-tem-  perature approximation:    N_ (l,  ) = Ni - N2 = ^2 [exp(-5/A7) - l ]    ^(-s/fcT),                           (8a)  N_ (2, 3) =N-i - Ny = N-i [l - exp(S/A:D]    ^(-S/fcD.                          (8b)    In this approximation both signals are of equal am-  plitude. The behaviour of the ESR signal at long times  is obtained by the approximation N/ ca ^N, and the  total triplet population decays as    dNldt=-T/kiN{W^^kiN=-k^N.        (9)    Therefore, the Boltzmann contribution to the EPR  signal (eq. (7)) is introduced as    N_s(t) = AT_B(O) exp(-/cT.r)                   (7')    with^V_B(0) = iN(0)(-S/kT). For the X-band fre-  quency of 9.60 GHz and at room temperature (T  = 298 K), one calculates for the Boltzmann signal    ^-B( )/MO) = 5.15 X 10-4.

(7') m the case  of fast relaxation (w &gt; k-J-) and no decay selectivity  (Afc = 0) may be combined with eq. (7) for the case  of weak decay selectivity- Since decay selectivity re-  sults in contributions of opposite sign for the high-  Held and low-field ESR signal, the existence of decay  selectivity becomes most readily apparent in a devia-  tion from equal amplitude of the high- and low-fielu  initial signal of the long-time decay.    554    3. Molecular systems and experimental techniques    - The photophysical properties of the excited states  ofacridine are rather well known. The fast population  of the lowest triplet state via singlet absorption and  intersystem crossing has been investigated by pico-  second transient absorption techniques (see, for  example, r f. [17]). The low-temperature kinetics of  the spin sub-levels of the lowest excited ^ srn* have  been the subject of a detailed ODMR study [18], in-  cluding the spin-lattice relaxation between 1.2 and  4.2 K. Although these data have been obtained m a  host crystal ofbiphenyl, the kinetic parameters as  far as investigated in the fluorene lattice turn out to  be very similar at low temperatures [19].    Above 80 K the 3^T^^* state ofacridine when dop-  ed in fluorene has been shown to decay via a thermal-  ly activated, non-radiative decay channel which is  limited to the central m thyl ne group of neighboring  fluorene molecules (as indicated by a strong deuterium  isotope effect) [13,14]. Also, in the same system a  photochemical hydrogen abstraction reaction from  the fluorene m thyl ne to the acridine aza group  forming a radical pair (RP) product has been identi-  fied [10,11]- The acridine triplet decay channel and  the RP formation have recently been shown to be  identical processes [20,12,14]. Further evidence for  these conclusions can be provided by transient ESR  results, as they render not only direct information on  the rates of the relevant population, relaxation and  decay processes of the individual spin sub-levels but  also on the spin selectivity of these processes.    The molecular and crystal structure and the axis  notation have been summarized previously [11].  Purification of the starting materials, crystal growing  and sample preparation follows the previous descrip-  tion [10]. Fully deuterated material has been used  primarily because a long intramolecular lifetime of  the triplet state provides an extended range for the  study of the additional photoreactive decay path. A  preferred orientation of the magnetic field with re-  spect to the crystalline lattice is along the crystalline    c axis, when all molecules become magnetically  equivalent with the magnetic field along the long in-  plane axis and perpendicular to the readily available  ab cleavage plane of the crystal.    Selective acridine singlet excitation is achieved  with an N3 laser at 337 nm with a 10 ns pulse width.    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    For J3||x||c, the electric-field vector of the light lies  in the crystalline ab plane. The pulsed ESR X-band  spectrometer is described elsewhere [21], and uses a  novel slotted-tube resonator [22]. The available mw  power of 4 W allowed a 90  pulse width of  50 ns.  The recovery time of the receiver system was s 300  ns. On this time scale, the jitter in the laser trigger  was negligible. The electron spin echo amplitude  could be measured as a function of the delay time T^  between the laser pulse and the 90  pulse of the echo  sequence and as a function of the pulse separation T  between the two mw pulses. The echo amplitude for  fixed time increments T^, T has been obtained typical-  ly from a field scan through the resonance field at a  fixed resonator frequency of  9.60 GHz.    Different two-pulse sequences (90  T 180  and  120  T 120 ) have been applied in this investigation.    The dynamic range of the detection systenrwas  not sufficient to handle the 5 orders of magnitude  difference between the initial and long-time ESR sig-  nal amplitude with one instrumental parameter set.    4. Results and discussion    Fig. 1 summarizes the essential features of the ex-  periment. For the field orientation B II x, the fixed  resonator frequency of 9.6 GHz and the known zero-  field splitting ofacridine [23,11], the field-swept    ESR spectrum consists of a low- (LF) and a high-field  (HF) line separated by 1072 G (corresponding to the  zero-field splitting parameter 22?). As the triplet state  is primarily populated in the zero-field spin state x,  for  \\x identical with the Zeeman level 0, the LF  signal will appear in emission and the HF signal in ab-  sorption.    Fig. 1 also shows the pulse sequence used- Follow-  ing the laser pulse at t = 0, the echo pulse sequence is  started after a variable delay time T^- For a fixed  pulse separation T, the echo amplitude represents the  population distribution over the triplet spin states at  the time t = r^. The expected time behavior of the  ESR signal amplitudes as a function of the delay time  T^ is given by eqs. (7) and (7'). and is shown sche-  matically in fig. 1 as well. The strongly polarized ini-  tial signals due to selective triplet population are de-  stroyed by spin relaxation.    For long times, HF and LF signals approach the  same absorptive Boltzmann signal unless selective de-  cay (Afc ^ 0) causes additional signal contributions of  opposite sign according to eq- (7). As long as relaxa-  tion and decay occur on rather different time scales,  they can be evaluated straightforwardly by separate  analyses of the short- and long-time behavior.    In order to determine the true signal amplitudes  of the LF and HF signals via the spin echo signals, we  have to solve an important problem caused by the  phenomenon of electron spin echo envelope modula-          N3 Laser Pulse    i^11    A    E    \ HF    LF          Spinecho    time    Fig. 1.

This is observed when the echo ampli-  tude is measured as a function of the pulse separation  r and has been analyzed recently for the case of triplet  states [8,9]. An example of such an ESEEM in our  system, where BQ is almost parallel to x, is shown in  fig. 2. An analysis of the ESEEM observed in the sys-  tem investigated here will be published elsewhere. LF  and HF signals show drastically different ESEEM pat-  terns similar to those observed in r f. [8] .'These  ESEEM patterns complicate the decay analysis- There-  fore, the signal amplitudes oftheHF and LF signals  as obtained via the echo amplitude cannot be com-  paed readily as needed for an analysis using eqs. (7)  and (T).    This problem has been solved by the following  normalization procedure for the signal amplitudes.    556    The echo amplitudes are measured for convenient  but fixed pulse separations r, which are slightly dif-  ferent for the HF and LF signals as marked by the  arrows in_fig. 2. In any case, the observed echo ampli-  tude is proportional to the desired signal amplitude  S(r-,) at the starting point of the echo sequence. If  there exists a time Ti for-which we can compare HF  and LF signals independently, we can use these am-  plitudes for signal normalization.    As mentioned in section 2, equal populations of  the outer Zeeman levels are expected in the high-  field approximation. For our experimental param-  eters, the high-field approximation is fulfilled within  ^3%. Within that accuracy, the initial signal ampli-  tudes of high- and low-field signals should be of iden-  tical amplitude but opposite sign.    Assuming a selective triplet population exclusively  into the x state or 0 Zeeman level, the initial popula-  tion difference normalized to the total triplet popula-  tion would be for the HF and LF signals:    (11)    Less complete selectivity would still render equal ab-  solute signal amplitudes for HF and LF signals but  mUi\N_(0)\fN&lt;l.    For practical reasons, the echo signal, as measured  with a fixed pulse separation T but as a function of  TL, is extrapolated back to T^ = 0 and first normaliz-  ed for the absorptive HF signal to +1 and for the  emissive LF signal to  1. Hence, we first assume com-  plete population selectivity according to eq. (11).  More meaningful would be a normalization to the  Boltzmann signal which, however, is not readily ob-  servable. Normalization to the highly spin-polarized  initial signals is experimentally more convenient while  the renonnalization to the Boltzmann signal can be  carried out later. The logarithm of the echo signal is  then plotted as a function of TT^ for the triplet state of  acridine-do in two fluorene hosts, fluorene-dgA^ in  fig. 3 and fluorene-d^ in fig. 4. The short-time be-  havior is shown on the left side and the long-time be-  havior on the right side of the figures.    In order to visualize the opposite sign of the emis-  sive signals, the logarithmic scale for the negative (emis-  sive) signals has been plotted by inverting the positive  scrle with respect to the time axis.    The wide dynamic range may be appreciated by the  fact that the signal amplitudes couldbe followed over    Volume 104, number 6  1.0    10-1    V)     :    0     J  Q    CL  &lt;    0    0    LiJ    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984          10-4.    10-    10-    HIGH FIELD          10-    Fig. 3.

Next, we point out the  good exponential time behavior both in the short- and  long-time region, as predicted by eqs. (7) and (7'). In  the relaxation regime T^ ^ 30  s, exponential signal  decay extends over nearly 3 orders of magnitude. Devia-  tions from exponentiality, in particular for the largest  signal amplitudes at short T^ in  g. 4, can be attribut-  ed to remaining saturation effects in the detection  electronics. They can be eliminated by using sufficient  signal attenuation for large amplitudes which, how-  ever, has to be done with consistent calibration to re-  tain an exact relation between the large initial signals  and the weak Boltzmann signals at long delay times    ^    The exponentials fitted to the data points are shown    as solid lines in figs. 3 and 4. The fitted parameters de-  fined in eqs. (7) and (7') are listed in table 1.    The important results reflected in table 1 may be  summarized as follows:    (a) At long times, HF and LF signals are identical  and absorptive. Hence, within experimental accuracy,  the long-time behavior reflects the Boltzmann signal  (7') and a non-selective decay, i.e. Afc = 0 in eq. (7).    (b) The observed decay times k~^1 agree very well  wth those measured independently for the acridine-dg  triplet state by triplet absorption [13,14] and for prod-  uct formation by time-resolved ONP [20]. The con-  siderably longer lifetime in the case of the deuterated  fluorene m thyl ne group reflects the isotope effect  found for the photoehemical H-abstraction reaction  [13,14].    (c) The triplet relaxation time (3w) 1 = 5.5 ps  compares well with the results obtained earlier with  the "delayed transient nutation" technique [24,25],    where complete relaxation parameters are obtained  from the orientational dependence of w.    (d)The nearly complete spin selectivity of the  acridine-dg triplet population known at low temper-  ature (P^ = 90% [18]) is retained at room temperature.    The fast intersystem crossing (ISC: Si -   T^ ; ^30  ps [17]) is not expected to show temperature-depen-  dent contributions. Therefore, the last result (d) is  not surprising; however, direct experimental evidence  was previously lacking.    As pointed out above, normalization to one for the  initial short-time signal is justified only when the  triplet population is completely selective with respect  to the middle Zeeman level. In this case, the initial  long-time signal is expected to correspond to the    Boltzmann value 5.15 X 10   given m eq. (10). In-  stead, smaller initial values are observed (figs. 3 and 4).  Note that a less complete population selectivity would  result in smaller absolute values of the initial short-  and long-time polarization. The ratio of long-time to  short-time initial values would be larger than the  Boltzmann value in this case, i.e. the discrepancy with  the experimentally observed values would be even  greater.    This discrepancy can be explained by a systematic  error not corrected for in figs. 3 and 4. Errors due to  aging of the crystal under strong UV irradiation have  been corrected by alternating long- and short-time  measurements. However, we have observed that the  echo modulation pattern is slightly different for short  and long T^. This may hint to a possible coherence in  the nuclear spin sub-levels [27]. In any case, it com-  plicates the analysis of the initial values for the long-  and short-time decay, which is based on a stable ESEEM    Table 1    List of parameters obtained by fitting eqs.

The sensitivity of the apparatus is sufficient to de-  tect the Boltzmann signal at long delay times. From  this we conclude that ESE signals should also be ob-  servable for the reaction product, the radical-pair trip-  let state ^ {^f. Due to incomplete knowledge of the  TR? kinetics [12,20,26] and its echo modulation,  the best choice for the delay and pulse separation  times (TT, T) remains unclear- So far, it has not been  possible to detect a T^p ESE signal.    5. Conclusions    We have demonstrated that the complete kinetics  of molecular triplet spin states can be determined  from ESE studies up to room temperature. A much  simplified analysis is possible when the time scales of  the various kinetic processes, i.e. triplet population,  spin relaxation and decay, are very different, as in  this paper. The time resolution of the ESE technique  (Ssl  s) is not only able to render the kinetic constants  of spin relaxation and decay but also the relative pop-  ulation and decay rates, i.e. the spin selectivity in pop-  ulation and decay can be obtained as well.    While the highly selective population of the acridine  triplet state known from low-temperature studies [18]  is retained up to room temperature, the high-tempera-  ture decay is non-selective within experimental accu-  racy. This is an important piece of information for the  RP formation, which dominates the high-temperature  acridine triplet decay [13,14]. It is consistent with a  triplet precursor for the reaction, i.e. the reaction pro-  ceeds via triplet triplet conversion from reactant to  product which leaves the spatial spin orientation un-  changed, resulting in equal (non-selective) reaction  rates from all spin states of the precursor triplet.    We have demonstrated that time-resolved ESR  provides a unique tool to obtain detailed information  about radiationless decay processes of excited molec-  ular triplet states.

Data from UV photoelectron spectroscopy  (Hel, Hell) are used in conjunction with EHT and MS Xa calculations. The experimental and theoretical results are used to  explain the reactivity of this compound within the frame work of perturbation theory.    1. Introduction    Two of us have recently described the synthesis, X-  ray diffraction, structure [2] and chemistry [3] of  l .l'-diphosphaferrocenes. The present work involves  a study of the electronic structure of this new system  by the combined use of photoelectron spectroscopy  and quantum-mechanical calculations. The reliability  of the EHT method for the correct estimation of rota-  tional barriers and conformations of transition-metal  complexes is well established [4 9]. We "initially ana-  lyzed the interactions between the different orbitais  of the phospholyl anion and iron fragments which are  responsible for the equilibrium configuration. We chose  the multiple scattering MS'Xa [10,11] method for  the description of the electronic structure. .    1.

In contrast to studies on the cyclo-  pentadienyl anion and benzene [20,21], its use does  not improve the results obtained for the phospholyl  anion. This is probably due to the lower symmetry of  the electronic distribution.    In terms of geometric parameters, experimental  X-ray diffraction values exist for diphosphaferrocene  [3]. Considering the data obtained with EHT, we per-  formed the Xa calculation in C^ symmetry. The z  axis is the C^ symmetry axis, while the xy plane is the  Oj, symmetry plane, they axis is perpendicular to the  phospholyl rings.    3. Ground-state electronic structure    Energies of this sandwich system, calculated with  the EHT method and taking the angle 0 defined below  as variable, are shown in fig. 1. Six conformations  were chosen. Three represent eclipsed (0 = 0, Ciy sym-  metry) or pseudo-eclipsed positions (0 = 76.91  and  145.42 , Cj symmetry) and three represent staggered  positions (0= 33.45  and 111.17 ^ Ci symmetry; 0 =  180 , C^h symmetry).    According to the EHT method, the energetically  favored conformation corresponds to Q = 145.42 .  This is in exact agreement with the experimental result.

The electronic factors determining the favored  conformation or the origin of "the barrier may be "  estimated from metal ligand interactions occurring as  a function of the respective orientations of the two  phospholyl fragments.    As in the case of five-meinbered heterocycle ho-  mologues [22] (C^y symmetry), the phospholyl anion  has two occupied ir b^ and one occupied v a^. orbitais.  We have previously proposed the order Ib^ &lt; la^ &lt;  2b^ [23]; there is also an a^ orbital localized on the a  lone pair of the phosphorus atom. Including the 3d  atomic orbitais of phosphorus, the virtual is orbitais  are 3b2,2a^, 4b^ and 3a^.    The orbitais of each phospholyl fragment m the dif-  ferent conformations interact each other, even though  the two rings are relatively far apart (3.314 A). These  interactions are a function of the symmetry of the sys-  tem and of overlap, and thus a function of the orienta-  tion of the rings.    Two of the conformations considered present ele-  ments of symmetry. In the cis form (C^y symmetry),  the  n  I-J orbitais give b^ (antibonding) and ai (bond-  ing) combinations, the  n a^ orbitais give a^ (antibond-  ing) and b^ (bonding) combinations and, finally, the  non-bonding a^ orbitais combine in b^ (antibonding)  and a^ (bonding) orbitais. In the trans form (C^ sym-  metry), the w b^ orbitais give the by and a  MOs, the  a^ orbitais give the b and a  combinations, while the  ai (np) orbitais give the b  and a  combinations. In  the conformations which present no element of sym-  metry (Cj), all interactions are allowed. It should  nonetheless be noted that, for Q =33.45  and 145.42 ,  the greatest interactions correspond to those'allowed  in the C'^y and C^ forms, respectively.    The occupied and virtual orbitais of the diphos-  pholyl fragment interact with the atomic orbital of  Fe21'. The frontier molecular orbitais of the latter  consist of three occupied 3d. atomic orbitais,-two va-  cant 3d atomic orbitais, three vacant 4p atomic or-  bitals and one vacant 4s orbital. Once again, these in-  teractions depend on the symmetry of the different  orbitais, in the cases where symmetry exists, and in  any case on the overlap between these orbitais as well  as their respective energies. For the sake of clarity, we  will only consider the global result of these interactions,  i.e. total charge transfers between the occupied and    562    virtual orbitais of each fragment. The values of these  transfers appear in fig. 1--           - - -    It can be seen that the strongest interactions occur  between the occupied orbitais of the ligands and the  vacant orbitais of iron, leading to high charge transfer  from the ligand to the metal. In addition, there is a  metal ligand transfer as a result of interactions be-  tween the occupied 3d atomic orbitais of iron and the  vacant orbitais of the ligands. Even though the latter  interactions are quantitatively weaker, it is this type  that apparently determines the favored conformation  of diphosphaferrocene, since their, relative variation is  the most pronounced. The small difference observed  between the 145  and 180  forms is thus interpreted  as interactions of the same nature. In EHT, this is re-  flected by similar energies for all the molecular or-  bitals. Considering the reduced calculation time for  such a system if it presents elements of symmetry, we  have performed the MS Xa calculation with the trans  form (C2h).    For this formally 3d6 compound, we observe the  sequence (10a )2, (6bg)2, (9ag)2 of MOs with metal  character, then(8bu)2, (8ag)2, (5a )2, (5bg)2 of MOs  with predominantly ligand character (ir type), then  (7by)2 and (7an)2 of MOs also with ligand character  (o type fro the non-bonding np AO).    The decrease of symmetry from D^ in ferrocene  to C^h allows a mixing between 3d^ 22 and 3d^2,  which corresponds to a change in the orientation of  these orbitais. It is interesting to note that this leads  to a greater possibility of interaction with the ligands.  This is shown by a greater metal coordinate transfer,  as demonstrated by the EHT approach.    The EHT and MS Xa calculations, with the aid of  MO contour plots (not included in this paper) enable  us to construct the most important interactions, as  shown in fig. 2.    We then attempted to estimate the charge of iron  in diphosphaferrocene. As shown by the results of  studies on several organometallic compounds [24,25],  the intersphere charge can be attributed to the ligands.  In the case of iron, this leads to the configuration  (3d6-6,4s0-25,4p -4). The charge of+0.75 on this  atom (in relation to Fe ) arises from the different  - coordinate metal and metal coordinate charge  transfers. This result appears to be reasonable in view  of those obtained with Co and Ni, +0.66 and +0.48  in Cp2Ni and in Cp^Co [18,19], and also in view of    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    3b2-  7a,_    Fe"      u  Bbr;:    --g^    7bg-  nac    -*Px    -4pz 4p    -Ap,    -4s    10  g-    2b,    (Hp)    ea,  p     -8"0-    - "'u    .-Sbg_  "Bay"    - ' B-  "7b -    "6^-    ^"g-    ^8b .

We thus have a transfer of0.41e~ from the 2p  orbitais of the ring atoms to the 4p atomic orbital  of iron and a 0.15e~ occupation of the 4s atomic  orbital of iron. Also, the evaluation of the popula-  tions of the 3dy,, and 3d ^ atomic orbitais of iron,  which participate primarily in the Sag, 7ag and 5bg  MOs, enables us to estimate an overall ligand-to-  metal transfer of 1.83e~.    Inversely, the interaction of the 3dFg occupied  AOs with the virtual orbitais of the ligands induces  a metal-to-ligand transfer, reflected by the stabiliza-  tion of the lOag, 6bg and 9ag MOs. In terms of a  formal 3d6 occupation, the d populations calculated  for these three MOs enable us to estimate a metal-to-  ligand transfer of^l^e^ These charge transfers are  thus on the same order as those calculated with the  EHT method.    Nevertheless, it is interesting 10 examine the IT elec-  tron distribution, in the light of the experimental data  on the reactivity of diphosphaferrocene towards elec-  trophiles. We thus partially summed the w-type or-  bitals, leading to the result P1-14 C^-03 C -94 for diphos-  phaferrocene and P1-24 C^-08 Cj-"8 for the phosphoiyl  anion. For diphosphaferrocene, we thus observe a de-  creased  n charge of phosphorus with respect to the  phosphoiyl anion- Even though the metal-to-ligand  charge transfer leads to an increased  a charge on phos-  phorus (important weight of this atom in 11 a,, molec-  ular orbital), there nevertheless exists a greater ligand-    563    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    to-metal charge transfer which removes  T charge from  this atom (especially in the Sag molecular orbital  which shows a participation of 26% for the phospho-  rus atom and 27% for the 3 dpg AOs). Concerning the  carbon atoms and with respect to phospholyl anion,  we observe a decrease of the v charge slightly more  important for Co than for Cy.    As a result of the ligand metal charge transfer (8b ,  Sag, Sau, 5bg, 6bu and Sag MOs), there is a quasi-  equivalent decrease of their it charge. The metal   ligand transfer leads to a slight back-donation which  is somewhat greater for Cy than for C  (greater weight  of the first atom in the Tbg orbital).    4. Photoelectron spectrum of diphosphaferrocene    We recorded the photoelectron spectrum of diphos-  phaferrocene A (fig. 3) and its tetramethyl derivative  B (table 2) with Hel (21.21 eV) and Hell (40.41 eV)  excitations. The interest of this double recording re-  sides in the fact that the photoionization cross section  depends both on the nature of the ionized orbitais and  the wavelength of the ionizing radiation. A compara-  tive analysis of band intensities thus leads to a less dif-  ficult and more reliable assignment of the spectra [23,  26-32].    The photoelectron spectrum of diphosphaferrocene  A (fig. 3) presents a first band at 7.5 eV, whose inten-  sity increases considerably in going from Hel to Hell  excitation. It may thus be unambiguously assigned to  the ionization to three orbitais (table 2), showing an  important participation of the 3d AOs of iron (lOag,  6bg and 9ag). On the contrary, the intensity of the  fourth band (10.15, 10.35 eV) decreases during the  HeI/HeII transition, and thus results from the ioniza-  tion of MOs which are highly localized on the phos-  phorus atoms, or more precisely on their o lone pair  (7bu and 7ag). The two intermediate bands are proba-  bly due to the four it MOs localized on the phospholyl  rings (8bu, Sag, 5au and 5bg).    Thus, there is a general satisfying agreement be-  tween the experimental and calculated values, since  the theoretical order is 3dpg, ^v^^, 2np. The transi-  tion-state formalism used enables a part of the relaxa-  tion energy to be taken into account, which is particu-  larly important for the d orbitais of transition metals.  Indeed, the differences between the calculated ioniza-  tion potentials and the corresponding orbital energy  (at convergence of the calculation) are visibly greater  for orbitais with a large Fe participation (3d) (^I.S  eV) than for those localized on the phospholyl ring  (between 2.3 and 2.5 eV).    The tetramethylation of diphosphaferrocene shifts  all the ionization potentials towards low energies. This  change is expected for potentials associated with or-  bitals localized on the ligands. It is also observed for  the first band, corresponding to the three orbitais with          Fig. 3.

This confirms the existence of non-negligible  interactions between 3d orbitais and the orbitais lo-  calized on the ligands. This agrees with the calculated  EHT and MS Xa charge transfers between these dif-  ferent orbitais.    The second band at 9.1 eV is of slightly lower in-  tensity (fig. 3) than the third. It results from the ioni-  zation of two orbitais highly localized on the phos-  phorus atom, i.e. prbitals Sby and 8ag, arising from the  combination of the 2b^ orbitais of each ring. The third  band (9.5 eV) corresponds to the ionization of 5au and  5bg MOs.    As we stated, the two ionization potentials (10.15  and 10.35 eV) are associated with two orbitais highly  localized on the a lone pairs of the phosphorus atoms,  in agreement with the theoretical results.    The slight difference between these two ionization  potentials, as well as the potentials attributed to the  states ^u and 2ApOa one hand and to 2A^ and ^g    on the other, agrees with a conformation of diphos-  phaferrocene in the vapor state which is identical to.  or at least very close to, that observed in the solid state    [2]-    The following ionization potentials, associated with  higher-energy doublet states, also appear to be in agree-  ment with the MS Xa calculation, if we compare the  effects of methylation and the localization of ionized  molecular orbitais.    5. Reactivity of diphosphaferrocene    Perturbation theory has been applied many times  with successful results to explain the reactivities of or-  ganic compounds and of transition-metal complexes.  According to this theory, the rate of reaction is related  to the stabilizing interaction energy, AE, associated  with the two reactants A and B [34 36] in the transi-  tion state:    565    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    (l)    It seemed interesting to attempt to account qualita-  tively for the observed reactivity of diphosphaferro-  cene [3] in order to determine the relative importance  of each term in (1).    One of the characteristics of diphosphaferrocene is  its ability to be easily functionalized (formylation,  acetylation, etc.) This reactivity towards electrophiles  is thus intermediate between that of phosphacyman-  trene [37] and that offerrocene [38]. Even though  the MS Xa calculation showed the C^ atoms to have  slightly more ir charge than the Co atoms, these charges  (1.03e for Cy and 0.94e for Cp) cannot explain the  reactivity observed using only the Coulomb term. The  second term in (1) is probably of primary importance  at this level. Electrophilic attack will be easier as the  ir-type orbitais localized to a considerable extent on  CQ atoms will be less stable. We must thus take into  account the molecular orbitais which are the result of  the combination of the it a^ orbitais of the phospholyl  anions, i.e. the 5a  and 5b  molecular orbitais (associ-  ated with the 9.5 eV ionization potential) but also those  which result from the frontier orbitais 9ag and 6bg  (associated with 7.5 eV ionization potential), which  presents a non-negligible localization on the C  atoms  as a result ofligand orbitais dpg interactions (table 2).    The comparative reactivities ofphosphacymantrene,  diphosphaferrocene and ferrocene are in total agree-  ment with the order of stability of the frontier orbitais  (respectively 8.25 [30], 7.5 and 6.8, 7.2 eV (32]) as  well as the is orbitais localized on the C  atoms (type  a^): 10.13,9.5 and 8.8,9.3 eV.    So acylation can be satisfactorily interpreted by the  nature and the energy of the highest occupied orbitais  of the complex. Attack by stronger electrophiles, how-  ever, such as benzoyl bromide, on the phosphorus  atom, an attack which destroys the complex above  80 C [3], is m agreement with the is charge of 1.14  calculated with MS Xa.    Phosphorus exhibits a lesser reactivity than phospha-  cymantrene towards nucleophiles such as alkyllithium  [3]. This behavior is correctly interpreted from the  localizations presented by the vacant frontier orbitais  of these two complexes. The two lower unoccupied  molecular orbitais (LUMOs) ofphosphacymantrene    566    are totally localized on the phosphorus atom [30],  while those of diphosphaferrocene include a consider-  able participation by the d atomic orbital of the metal.    In parallel to this behavior toward electrophiles and  nucleophiles, corresponding to the aromatic nature of  this complex and thus involving the it system, a P-com-  plexation is observed, as in the case of phosphacyman-  trene [39]. This nucleophilic character of phosphorus,  similar to that ofphosphacymantrene, can be explained  only by participation of orbitais localized on these  lone pairs: 7ag (associated with the 10.15 eV potential)  and 7bu (10.30 eV), but also   as we have stated    10a , much less localized on the lone pairs but which  may participate because of its high energy (7.5 eV).    This brief analysis shows the relative importance  of the Coulomb and orbital terms in the expression  for AE, the stabilization energy of the supersystem.  It appears that the Coulomb term is predominant  during attack by strong electrophiles which decom-  pose the complex. On the other hand, acylation reac-  tions and nucleophilic attack by M-BuU can be related  to the localization and the energies of the frontier TT  orbitais of the system. The Coulomb term, even if  moderately important, becomes secondary.    P-complexing, on the other hand, can be explained  only by a frontier-orbital control involving the a or-  bitals associated with the lone pairs.    Acknowledgement    The authors thank Dr. J.

COUPLING CONSTANTS  VIA AN INTERMEDIATE BOND: A POLARIZATION PROPAGATOR ANALYSIS *    Mario A. NATIELLO and Rub n H. CONTRERAS*    Departamento de Fisica. Facultad de Ciencias Exactasy Naturales, Unisersidad de Buenos Aires.  Ciudad Universitaria. PabeUon 1. 1428 Buenos Aires. Argentina    Received 22 November 1983    Inner projections of the polarization propagator were used to study the indirect through-space transmission of the  Fenni contact tenn of C-F couplings via a C X (X = F, H) intermediate bond. When X = H a large capability for trans-  mitting this component is observed. But for X = F a notable inhibition of this transmission mechanism is observed. The  role of the fluorine lone pairs in this behaviour is discussed.    1. Introduction    The through-space transmission of spin spin cou-  pling constants has received a good deal of attention  since a deep understanding of the electronic mechanisms  involved in it could yield information on the molecular  structure. A detailed account of known trends in this  type of transmission is given in Hilton and Sutcliffe's  review [1 ]. Afterwards, several attempts were made  for studying the through-space transmission from a  theoretical point of view; the most important are the  following: Both versions of the NNBI (neglect of non-  bonded interactions) method [2,3]; the PRMO (par-  tially restricted molecular orbitais) method [4] ; and  the use of inner projections of the polarization propa-  gator (IPPP) [5].    In a previous paper [6] a new through-space  mechanism was suggested through an analysis with  the PRMO method. This new type can be referred to  as an indirect through-space transmission via an inter-  mediate bond. For H H couplings in anisoles it was  a small component [6]. Afterwards, this indirect  through-space component was calculated for F H cou-  plings [7,5], although in this case also its magnitude    * Part ofaPhD thesis (MAN) to be presented to the University    of Buenos Aires.  '" Member of the Argentine National Research Council    (CONICET).    was small enough as to be of no practical value. How-  ever, in other instances, specially in couplings where  a carbon atom is involved, there is experimental evi-  dence pointing towards a larger contribution for this  mechanism. This is the case, for instance, in the three-  bond C C coupling in crotonaldehyde [8]; and in  C F couplings in some monofluoro-substituted poly-  cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [9], and in N-rnethyl-8-  fluoroquinolinium iodide [10]- In this last compound,  Barfield et al. [10] measured a four-bond C F cou-  pling between the methyl carbon and the fluorine  atom in ring position 8 as 16.31 Hz. They assumed  that this coupling is mainly transmitted by a through-  space mechanism. They carried out FPT INDO [11]  calculations for different values of the N-methyl group  angle rotation, the average of the calculated values  being in satisfactory agreement with the experimental  value. In their calculation a periodicity of 120  is ob-  served for this four-bond coupling, their maxima coin-  ciding with an all-cis conformation of one C H methyl  bond with respect to the fluorine atom. This observa-  tion suggests that the indirect through-space mecha-  nism quoted above would be the main one operating  in this case. The agreement between the INDO calculat-  ed value with that determined experimentally suggests  that this semi-empirical method describes properly this  type of transmission.    In orderlo achieve a better understanding of this    568    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    coupling via an intermediate bond, in this paper the  IPPP method [5] is used to investigate the through-  space transmission of three-bond C F couplings in  cis-l,3-diiluoro-(I),cis-l,3-trinuoro-(II)and cis-1,3-  tetrafluoro-propene (III), between the vinyl fluorine  and the methyl carbon atoms. It can easily be assumed  that the fluorine lone pairs play an important role in  this transmission. However, the IPPP method as it  stands according to r f. [5], does not allow us to dis-  criminate their contribution. For this reason in this  paper a new and more versatile version of the IPPP  method is proposed.    The present analysis is based on an INDO ground-  state wavefunction, and the polarization propagator is  used at the RPA level [12].    2. Method    The IPPP method allows for the selection of a local  subspace of the MOs together with its complement,  thus defining a new basis set, where the propagator  matrix is calculated and inner-projected onto the local  subspace. A standard RPA calculation with the project-  ed propagator yields the local contribution to the RPA  coupling. Selection and projection are performed  simultaneously in one stage, and no distinction of or-  bitals within the local subspace can be made. For in-  stance, when calculating the through-space component  of the three-bond C F coupling in I. the local sub-  space contains fourteen MOs. representing, respectively.  the two C F and the two methyl C H bonding or-  bitals; the four corresponding antibonding orbitals,  and six fluorine lone pairs. These localized MOs are ob-  tained as those with maximum projection onto the  AO manifold spanned by the following orbitals: those  of the fluorine atoms; those of the carbon atoms bond-  ed to the F atoms; and those of the two methyl hy-  drogen atoms [5].    The new version allows for a separate performance  of the selection and projection stages, repeating the  former as many times as necessary so as to obtain the  desired transformation of the canonical orbitals. In ad-  dition, the projection stage allows for an arbitrary  selection of the transformed molecular orbitals which  are to be included in the projection manifold. Thus,  the procedure to eliminate the lone pairs of a given  fluorine atom from a through-space calculation re-  quires three stages: Firstly, the standard w-dimen-  sional through-space manifold is selected. Secondly.  three orbitals with maximum projection onto the  fluorine atomic orbitals are chosen within the previous  set. These three orbitals resemble quite closely the  fluorine lone pairs. Thirdly, the inner-projection is  performed using the m   3 remaining orbitals of the  local set selected in the first stage, except for a uni-  tary mixing amond them.    Calculations were performed on an IBM 370/3032  system using the CNINDO program [13] coupled with  a home-made implementation of the IPPP method.  Geometries were obtained from the standard model of  Pople and Gordon [14].    3. Results and discussion    In fig. 1 the through-space component of the Fermi  contact term of the ^J^-p coupling (methyl C and  vinyl F atoms) are shown for compounds I and III  versus the rotation angle Q of the methyl moiety. 0=0   corresponds to an all-cis conformation between one  methyl C F bond and the vinyl C F bond. When          180     Fig. 1- Indirect through-space component of the Fermi con-  tract term of ^c F coupling constant (methyl C and vinyl  F atoms) in compounds I (* ) and in ("). a = 0  corresponds  to an all-cis confonnation between the vinyl C F bond and  one methyl C F bond. Only the points shown were calculated.  Others were interpolated with the spline method.    569    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    three fluorine atoms are attached to the methyl group,  compound III, then only a small negative through-  space component is obtained. Small variations are ob-  served for different angles. The largest magnitude is  =a2.6 Hz for 0=0 , 120 , and 240 , i.e. for. conforma-  tions with a methyl C F bond cis with respect to the  vinyl C F bond. A quite different behaviour is observ-  ed in compound I. While a small negative through-space  component is transmitted via the methyl C F bond  for 0 = 0 , a large positive component is obtained for  Q = 120  and 240 , i.e. when a methyl C-F bond is  cis to the vinyl C F bond. Therefore, it is concluded  that a C H bond is far more efficient for an indirect  through-space transmission than a C F bond. It is  also conspicuous that there is a different behaviour  for Q = 180  in compounds I and III- This conforma-  tion corresponds to a spatially proximate configura-  tion of the methyl C F rear-lobe and the vinyl C-F  bond. While in compound I a significant positive com-  ponent is leaking the rear-lobe, in compound III only  a small negative contribution is obtained. The reason  for this different behaviour should be found in the  rear-lobe proximity to the lone-pair electrons of the  other two fluorine atoms in 111.

For e = 240  the methyl C-H bond is placed in  an all-cis conformation with respect to the vinyl C F bond.  The interpolation technique quoted in fig. 1 was also used.    570    sponding C F coupling in compound II is displayed.  Trends discussed above for compounds I and III are  confirmed in compound II. For 0 = 240  the methyl  C H bond is placed cis to the vinyl C F bond and a  large positive contribution is calculated. For 0 = 180   the rear-lobe effect observed in I is not present; it can  be spoken of as an inhibition of this channel owing  to the proximity of the lone pairs of the second  methyl fluorine atom. Compairing the maximum val-  ues of the transmission via a C H bond in compounds  I and II, it is found: ^^pCnO0; 240 ) = 13.96 Hz  in I-, and 37TSF(240 ) = 16.64 Hz in II. As the same  geometrical data were used for both compounds, this  difference comes exclusively from an electronic effect.  That is to say. a substituent effect is operating for this  type of through-space transmission. It is interesting  to point out that. on qualitative grounds, Mallory et  al. [15] concluded that the through-space component  of the peri-F F coupling in substituted fluorinated  naphthalenes does not show a significant substituent  effect. It remains to be assessed if such a conclusion  is valid for mechanisms defining the through-space  component of F F couplings, or, on the contrary, it  should be modified once a more detailed study is car-  ried out.    In order to understand the role played by the  fluorine lone pairs in inhibiting the indirect through-  space interaction, the new version of the IPPP method,  briefly described in the preceding section, was used    Table 1    The role played by the fluorine lone pairs in the indirect  through-space transmission of the Fermi contact term of the  3 fC F coupling constant for 0 = 0  in compound I (cis-1,3-  difluoropropene).

Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    for compound I. Table 1 shows how the through-space  component of the C F coupling analysed above is  affected when the fluorine lone pairs are excluded from  the projection manifold. These calculations were car-  ried out only for the 0=0  conformation. These  results indicate that the interaction of the lone pairs  of both fluorine atoms causes the inhibition of the  indirect through-space transmission.    It remains to confront these peculiar trends of the  indirect through-space transmission with experimental  measurements. Data taken from the current literature  seem to support them: (i) the Barfield et al. paper  [10] already mentioned; (ii) a comparison between  the three-bond ^c(2)-F ^^CW^-F couplings m 2-  iodo-a,Q:,a-triiruorotoluene and in 3-iodo-(Xja,a-tri-  fluorotoluene gives further support to an indirect  through-space transmission via a C H bond. In fact.  while in the latter compound ^ /r(2) F = 3.9 Hz and  ^CdS^-F = 3-^ ^z-in tne former the corresponding val-  ues are ^cm-F = 2-0 Hz and ^CCoy-F = 5-6 Hz [16],  i.e. the steric interaction between the trifluoromethyl  group and the ortho iodine atom renders as preferen-  tial a conformation with a C F bond proximate in  space to the C H bond placed in the ring position 6.  Thus we interpret the enhancement of the 3 fc(6)- :    coupling as resulting from an indirect triplet singlet  coupling via the C(6) H(6) bond.    Experimental evidence for the inhibition of indirect  through-space coupling via a C F bond is obtained  when analysing the experimental values of Schaefer et  al. [17] in 2-triiluoromethylphenyldiiluorophosphine.  In fact, while a large 4Jp_F coupling of 68.3 Hz was  found, which is assumed to be mainly transmitted  through-space via the phosphorus lone pair [17], the  corresponding ^p^ coupling was found to be of on-  ly  2.5 Hz, i.e. the intermediate C F bond renders  quite a small coupling.    o and IT transmission mechanisms of the Fermi con-  tact interaction were also considered. They will not  be described in detail. Important contributions from  the first one were obtained in all three compounds.  Their values range from 12.40 to 15.63 Hz in I; from  14.44 to 18.11 Hz in II; and from 17.42 to 19.66 Hz  in HI. A small and negative Tr-transmitted component  was also determined, its magnitude always being smal-  ler than 3 Hz.    Finally, it must be mentioned that SCPT INDO  [18] non-contact terms were also evaluated for differ-  ent conformations of the fluoromethyl groups. In all    cases non-contact contributions are much smaller than  the Fermi contact term, and in no case is larger than 1  Hz.

USA    Received 2 September 1983    Calculations on the ground states of the helium isoelectronic series aie carried out using variational wavefunctions of  the fonn ^ (x ,y), in which x and y are the combinations r^ + r^ * r^ occurring in the Coulomb Green's function. The re-  sults for helium are the most accurate to date using a two-variable wavefunction, accounting for 71.5% of the correlation  energy.    The Coulomb Green's function is the solution un-  der specified boundary conditions of the differential  equations [1] :    (|A2+^V?+2/r,-)G(r^,r2,&lt;:)=o(r^), 2= 1,2.         We use atomic units, whereby fi = e = JJ = 1. The sum  ofeqs. (1) over the two particle labels gives    (k2^ iV^+5V^+Z//i +Z|r^G(r^,r^k)=26(^^),    (2)  which closely resembles the Schrodinger equation for  a helium-like atom. As shown by Hostler [2], the  Coulomb Green's function depends on just two vari-  ables:    G^J'^) = -(mk^Cx -y)-\'o/9x - 9/9y)  X r(l -i^M^-iky^W^-ikx),  y=Z/fc, Imft&gt;0,                      (4)    (3)    y=r^+r^-r^,    rather than three   say r^, r^, r^   which would be  expected on the basis of relational invariance alone.  This reduction is a consequence of the S0(4) dynam-  ical symmetry of the Coulomb problem. This higher  symmetry is also. connected with the existence of an  additional constant of the motion, the Runge Lenz  vector.    Specifically the retarded Coulomb Green's func-  tion G+(!c,.y .A),is given by [3] :          -    572    in which M and W are Whittaker functions as defined  by Buchholz [4].    In this note, we shall explore variational wavefunc-  tions of the form ^/(x,y) to approximate ^S states  of the helium isoelectronic series. Rigorously, of  course, three variables such as r^, r-^, r^ are required  to span the functional domain for S states. It is of in-  terest, nevertheless, to see how far one can go with  justx andJ' dependence.    The classical work ofHylleraas [5] was based on  the independent variables:    s=r^+r^, ^^i-^' u'=ir\^            (5)    Since x = s + u and y = s   u, our computations will  be equivalent to those of Hylleraas with the variable  r absent.    . ,    For helium-like systems, the hamiltonian is given    ^       . _  H=-^-^-Zlr^-Zfr^ lr^.

In table 3, we present analogous calculations, using  the fifteen-term function, on the Is2 1 S ground states  of the helium isoelectronic sequence from Z = 1 to  Z = 9. The results are compared with the self-consis-  tent-field calculations of Roothaan and Weiss [7] and  the essentially exact 13th-order perturbation calcula-  tions of Scherr and Knight [8] - As shown in the last  column of table 3, the fraction of correlation energy  captured by \l/(x,y) increases to over 75% for two-  electron atoms beyond helium.    The calculations on helium-like systems described  in this note are the rnost accurate to date based on  wavefunctions dependent on just two variables.    574    References    [1] 1. Meixner, Math.

Sapporo 060, Japan  Received 2 December 1983    Calculations are reported for the symmetric bending and stretching vibrational states of HsO1' and DsO* including cou-  pling between these two modes. The calculations were carried out by using a potential surface calculated by the SCr CI  method and expressed m terms of symmetric internal coordinates. The transition energy of the u;(l"  &lt;- G*) inversion mode  is found to be 985 cm"1, which is comparable to the experimental value of 954.417 cm"1 observed by Haese and Oka.  The calculated inversion doubling of the lowest state is 51 cm"1.    1. Introduction    The H30+ ion is of astrophysical importance [1 ].  Halley's comet will come close to the earth in the  near future, and it may be possible to observe gas-  phase spectra ofH^O'1" in the comet. The ion has  been detected in a gas-phase ion molecule reaction  [2]. Only a few absorption bands, observed using  high-resolution infrared spectroscopy, have been re-  ported [3,4] . More spectroscopic data in the gas  phase may be obtained by using new experimental  te cliniques -    A few vibrational calculations on this ion have  been carried out [5 9]. These start with the deter-  mination of an adiabatic potential surface using ab  initio molecular orbital methods. The first investiga-  tion of the symmetric vibration was performed by  Diercksen, Kraemer and Roos [5] (DKR). In their  calculation, however, only 14 geometry points were  used to construct the potential surface. This number  of points seems to be insufficient to describe higher  energy levels. Spirko and Bunker [6] performed a  vibrational calculation based on the non-rigid invertor  hamutonian, using the potential points of DKR. Re-  cently, Bunker, Kraemer and Spirko [7] (BKS) cor-  rected an error in the calculation of Spirko and  Bunker and improved the calculation by adding more  potential points. Colvin et al. [8] reported harmonic    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    vibrational frequencies (c g) of symmetric and asym-  metric vibrations obtained using a new potential sur-  face determined from an SCF calculation. The in-  version doubling was not investigated in this work.  After the present investigation was completed, we  became aware of work by Boschwina, Rosmus and  Reinsch [9] (BRR). They report an investigation  similar to the present one using a potential surface  obtained from the coupled electron pair approxima-  tion (CEPA). As sliown in section 2, we use the con-  figuration interaction (CI) method with the calcula-  tion carried out at 64 geometry points. The present  method of calculation is different from previous ones.  The purpose of this work is to predict transition fre-  quencies of low-lying symmetric vibrational levels of  I^ty^ and D^cy1'. It is hoped that this information  will be of some help to experimentalists in finding  the molecule in space and in assigning new bands in  the laboratory.    2. Method of calculation  2.1. Potential surface    The potential-energy surface is calculated using    575    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    SCF and CI methods, keeping the molecule symme-  tric (C3y for bent structures and Dgi, for planar).    The basis set of contracted gaussian-type orbitais  (CGTOs) can be designated (5s3p2d/3slp). Van  Duijneveldt's [10] (9s5 p) set is contracted to [5s3p]  for oxygen [I I] and the hydrogen [3sJ set (from  van Duijneveldt's (5s) set) is contracted to (3,1,1).  Rauk et al. [12] pointed out that the use of two 3d  functions is significant in predicting the inversion bar-  rier ofNH3.Two primitive 3d gaussian-type orbitais  are thus included as polarization functions on oxygen  (orbital exponents 1-472 and 0.491). The orbital ex-  ponent of the hydrogen polarization function (2p)  is 1.0.    First, SCF calculations are carried out for the  ground state. Using the molecular orbitais thus deter-  mined, CI calculations are then performed. The con-  figuration state functions (CSFs) are generated by  single and double excitations from the SCF ground-  state configuration, where K-sheU electrons are kept  frozen. The number of CSFs thus generated is 5757.  Calculations were performed at 64 points of symme-  tric geometry. The geometry parameters r (OH dis-  tance) and B (angle between the OH bond and the  inversion plane) were in the ranges 0.8996 &lt; r  &lt; 1.0584  and 0&lt;0 &lt;S45 .    2.2. Vibrationat calculation    In deriving the hanultonian operator for a sym-  metric vibration, we assume that asymmetric compo-  nents of the nudear motion are frozen. The hamil-  tonian operator is expressed as    ^ft^/suA?   1\Q2 fi2 l fco^Q , 1 \ 3  "    2 \ M   3m) 9^2   2 r \ M   3m) 3r     h1 i (cos^e   i \ a2   n2 sin (20) a2    2 y2 V M   3ro7^2 TM  r   ar98    fi2 sin (20) 3  ' 2M   y2    0)    where M and m are the masses of the oxygen nucleus  and proton, respectively.

Only even numbers are allowed  for n, (0 &lt;S n, &lt;S 10) and k, ranges from 0 to 10. The  deviation of the fitted potential from the calculated  energies is of the order of 10~6 hartree.    The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the opera-  tor (1) are obtained by expanding the wavefunction  X(r, 0) as a linear combination of 216 products of  gaussian-type (Hermite) functions:    11 17  ^ 0)=z  So ^WG^O),           (3)    where    F^r) = (r - 7-0)" exp [-a(r - r^)2}    and    G(6)=ffmexp(-b02).

Matrix elements between such functions are  calculated numerically by the simple Newton-Cotes  formula. The expansion coefficients (Pnm) are ^e'  tennined using the Ritz variational scheme.    3. Results and discussion    Results of the CI calculations are shown in table 1,  where they are compared with those ofDKR [5] . The  total energy at the equilibrium structure is a little  lower in the present calculation than that ofDKR,  and the absolute value of our correlation energy is  greater than that ofDKR. Other properties are al-  most the same in these two calculations. Only one d  function was used by DKR, whereas two d functions  were-used in the present work. The results indicate  that an additional d function does not affect the in-  version barrier significantly.    Calculated symmetric vibrational energy levels are  presented m table 2. They are.compared with other    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    Table 1  Properties of^O* from the CI calculations    Property    This work    DKR [5]        total energy at equilibrium    geometry (harrree) -76.563579 -76.541803  correlation energy    (hartree) -0.229797 -0.212027  equilibrium geometry    r W 0.975 0.972  e (deg) 17.0 17.3  inversion barrier    (kca /niol) 2.20 2.05    calculations [5,7,9] and with experiment [4]. We  have written a new program for solving the vibrational  problem on two-dimensional surfaces. We used it for  the same potential points as DKR.

The calculated transition energies agree -well    with experiment-  Let us compare other lower allowed transition  energies obtained from recent calculations (the num-  bers are given in the order present result, BRR, BKS):    (0,0^-(0,0~) transition, 5  , 46 and 72 cm-  ;    (O.O-)-(O, I'1") transition, 560, 559 and 511 cm-1 ;    (0,0~)-(0,2"'") transition, 1474. 1441 and 1461 cm-1:    (0,0''')-(0,2~) transition, 2113,2058 and 2127 cm-1 :    it can be seen that the results of the three calculations  are close to each other.    Since it may be convenient to the experimentalist  to have data on D30"1", results for this species are in-  cluded in table 2.    m summary, symmetric OH stretching and bend-  ing vibrational levels have been calculated using a  symmetric potential surface obtained by fairly ex-  tensive CI calculations. The (0,0"'")-(0,1-) transi-  tion energy is calculated to be 985 cm-1, which  should be compared with the observed energy of  954.417 cm-1. The inversion doubling is calculated  to be 51 cm~1, which is close to that obtained by  BRR (47 cm-1). Calculations of transition probabili-  ties among various energy levels of H^O"'" and D30"'"  are in progress.    Acknowledgement    The authors are grateful to Professor D. Sasaki.

IMPEY and Michael L. KLEIN  Chemistry Division, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada Kl A OR6    Received 13 December 1983    A simple interniolecular potential function is derived for liquid ammonia that is suitable for computer simulations- The  potential is shown to yield reasonable thermodynamic and structural data. The model is further tested by carrying out mo-  lecular dynamics calculations on solid ammonia.    1. Introduction    The properties of both solid and liquid ammonia  continue to attract interest. On the experimental side  structural [1] and thermodynamic [2] information  on the liquid has recently been supplemented by ad-  ditional thermodynamic investigations [3 5]. The  discovery of at least three new, previously unsuspect-  ed, high-pressure crystallographic modifications of  solid ammonia has added further impetus to this sub-  ject [6,7] . On the theoretical side there has been con-  siderable effort to rationalize the observed behaviour  of the fluid in terms of effective two-body poten-  tials suitable for carrying out computer simulation  calculations [8 11 ].    The derivation of simple effective two-body po-  tentials for hydrogen-bonded solids and liquids has  a long history, starting with the work of Bernai and  Fowler [12]. The present article continues their basic  approach but with application specifically to am-  monia. In section 2 we describe our model and in  section 3 we describe the computer-simulation calcu-  lations for liquid ammonia [8,11]. Section 4 contains  some results for solid ammonia in both orientational-  ly ordered (hydrogen-bonded) and disordered phases.  The article ends with a summary.    2. Intennolecular potential    We follow the basic approach of Bemal and Fowler    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    [12] and represent the ammonia intermolecular po-  tential as a sum of electrostatic interactions between  suitably chosen charge sites on each molecule and a  single Lennard-Jones (12 6) poten al between the  nitrogen atoms. Jorgensen et al. have achieved reason-  able success by applying this basic approach to water  [13] and hydrogen fluoride [14]. In the case ofwa-  tsr, three charge sites are necessary [13] and a sim-  ilar situation pertains in hydrogen fluoride [14]. The  representation of the charge distribution of ammonia  via an array of charges was discussed in detail by  Hinchliffe et al. [9] . For simplicity we have adopted  their model C. Thus the charge distribution of the  ammonia molecule (&lt;^NH = 1-0124  .C?HH = 1.6243 A)  is represented via four charges. The three hydrogen  atoms each carry a charge of Q^ = 0.462 e and the  fourth charge site Q =  30^ is displayed a distance  5 = 0.156 A along the  3 symmetry axis. towards  the H atoms. Such a model gives a 1% enhanced di-  pole moment (1.50 D) and a fitted value for the qua-  drupole moment (-2.12 D A) [9].    To complete the intermolecular potential we need  to specify the parameters of the Lennard-Jones  (12 6) potential for the nitrogen nitrogen interac-  tions:    V^K) = 46[(o/J?)12 - (a/R)6}.    From a consideration of the crystal structure of  solid ammonia [15,16] and. the crystal sublimation  energy (37 kJ/mol) [17], preliminary poten al pa-  rameters ex,M and OMM are readily selected. Molec-    579    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    ular dynamics calculations on liquid ammonia, to be  described in section 3, were then used to refine the  choice of parameters. The final values adopted were  e= 140 K and o = 3.40 A. We note that with these  parameters the coefficient o{R~6 is  40% larger  than the best theoretical estimate [18]. In view of  the omission of the higher-order terms in the disper-  sion series, this is perhaps a necessary result. If an  enhanced dipole moment is used the coefficient of  R~6 can be reduced bur we did not attempt to op-  timize this partitioning of the total energy between  electrostatic and dispersion interactions. We remind  the reader that the model we are using is an effective  two-body potential that ignores induction and other  explicit many-body interactions that undoubtedly  play a role in the real fluid.    3. Molecular dynamics calculations for the liquid    As mentioned in section 2, a preliminary choice  of potential parameters was tested by studying the  structure of liquid NH3.

The equations of motion were integrated by a third-  order predictor corrector algorithm for the transla-  tions and fourth-order algorithm for the rotational  motion, which was handled using quaternions [19].  The resulting radial distribution functions are shown  in fig. 1 and the MD data are quoted in table 1. The  NN distribution function compares quite favorably  with the room-temperature X-ray data ofNarten [1].  Table 1 gives thermodynamic data  which are quite  acceptable [2]. The time dependence of the molec-  ular centre of mass displacements can be analyzed  to yield an estimate of the self-diffusion constantu.  At T = 260 K we find D = 5 X l O-5 cn^/s.    4. Molecular dynamics calculations on the solid phase    Since the intermole cular potential model appears  to be quite reasonable for liquid ammonia, we now  turn to a discussion of the various solid phases [5 7].  For this purpose we employed the so-called new mo-  lecular dynamics (NMD) computer simulation tech-  nique introduced by Pamnello and Rahman [20] and  suitably generalized to handle a polar molecular sol-  id [21]. The technique is described in r f. [21] so  we omit most of the details. In essence, the phase tra-  jectories of the individual molecules are determined  for a system subjected to a specified external pres-  sure. The basic MD cell is allowed to change its vol-  ume and shape in response to any net imbalance be-  tween the external pressure and the internally gener-  ated stresses in the system. In principle, the system  could, if it so desired, undergo a structural phase tran-  sition [20^1].

Or entat onally disordered hexagonal phase    At low pressures and temperatures ammonia has  the cubic P2^ 3 structure. In this phase each ammonia  molecule is hydrogen bonded to six nearest neigh-  bours at 3.35 A, a further six (non-hydrogen-bonded)  neighbours are at 3.88 A [15,16]. The structure can  be visualized as a weakly distorted, close-packed fee  lattice. We carried out several NMD calculations in  this fully ordered structure. A typical low-temperature  result is given in table 2- At the experimental density  corresponding to liquid-nitrogen temperature the  model yields a pressure of 1.4 kbar. Such a finding  is to be expected because the classical molecular dy-  namics calculations do not include the contribution  to the pressure that arises from the zero-point vibra-  tions. In the ordered cubicP2i3 crystal the molecular  dipole moments ( 3 axes) point along the crystal-  lographic &lt;111&gt; directions. A convenient way to mon-  itor the molecular order is therefore to expand the  orientational probability distribution function for  the molecular  3 axes,/(u) in Kubic harmonies [22]    4ir/-(u)=l+C4^4+....    The quantity  4, which can serve as an order param-  eter, is the ensemble average of the Kubic harmonic  A^^l/lo^/^SC^+J't+z^-S] an&lt;lu=(x,y,z)  is a unit vector along the dipole ( 3) axis.

In a fully  orientationally disordered cubic crystal c^ = 0. We  conclude that our simple potential model is able to  generate a stable hydrogen-bonded ammonia crystal.

We have car-  ried out a number of molecular dynamics calcula-  tions for this high-pressure phase, typical thermo-  dynamics results are given in table 2- The calculated  structure at 15 kbar and r= 223 K was found to  have a nearly ideal c/a ratio and appeared to be stable.  The nature of the orientational disorder was charac-  terized by examining the projection of the molecular  dipole ( 3) axes onto the crystallographic c axis. We  found no evidence for any degree of orientational  order in our calculations.    An additional calculation was carried out at lower  pressure (8 kbar) and higher temperature (258 K) in  order to probe the range of stability of the hep phase.  Under these conditions the initial hep crystal was ob-  served to transform to a bcc structure. Unfortunate-  ly, although the melting behaviour of ammonia seems  to be anomalous there is no experimental evidence  for the formation of a bcc phase before melting [3].  We conclude therefore that the generation of this  stable bcc phase is an artifact of the model potential.  Before leaving this section we comment briefly on  the mechanism we observed for this hep -&gt;  bcc tran-  sition. Simply stated, the hep basal planes become  &lt;110) planes of the bcc lattice. To do so the a and b  nearest-neighbour vectors of the hep basal plane be-  come nearest-neighbor (111) and next-nearesi-neigh-  bour &lt;100&gt; vectors of the bcc lattice and the angle  between a and b increases from 120  to 125.26  (ir  minus half the tetrahedral angle). Alternate basal  planes also undergo small relative displacements which  implies a softening of the hep Raman-active T point  phonon- Another way of looking at the transition is  to note that the hep basal planes, which can be re-  garded as centred rectangular 1 X 31/2 lattices, trans-  form to centred 1 X 21^2 rectangular lattices (i.e. bcc  [110] planes).    4.3. Orientational disordered cubic phase    For p &gt; 7 kbar at T&gt; 260 K the solid (called phase  III) that grows from the liquid is an orientationally  disordered cubic (fee) crystal- Application of pres-  sure to this phase yields a new, bir fringent (rhombo-    581    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    hedral?) phase for pressures in excess of  25 kbar  [6,7] . We attempted to carry out a study of the fee  orientationally disordered phase III. To do so we  started our NMD simulations from an orientational-  ly disordered configuration, whose centre of mass  separations were appropriate top s  17 kbar. After  a period of equilibration we obtained the thermo-  dynamic quantities listed in table 2. Examination of  the atomic distribution functions confirmed that we  had an orientationally disordered fee sample. A longer  NMD run was then initiated with p = 17.4 kbar (see  table 2). After a period of 2000 time steps of 2 fs  the sample fully transformed into an orientationally  disordered bcc crystal whose thermodynamic param-  eters are quoted in table 2. The transformation was  readily apparent from the behavior of the nitrogen  atom pair distribution function. In the fee phase the  coordination number is 12 while in the bcc phase it  shifts to 14. We con dude that our simple intermolec-  ular potential is therefore unable to stabilize the orien-  tationally disordered fee phase. The observed mecha-  nism of the fee ~&gt;- bcc transition was the classic one  [20], the body-centred tetragonal cell of the fee lat-  tice, with a : b : c in the ratios 1 :1 :21^2, transform-  ing to 1 :1 :1 (bec).    5. Summary    We have introduced a simple intermolecular po-  tential function for ammonia that is suitable for car-  rying out computer simulations on the liquid. The  potential model is similar to models proposed recent-  ly for the hydrogen-bonded liquids H^O and HF [13-  14]. The model we propose for ammonia appears  to be successful in describing the liquid and the low-  temperature solid. (This finding is perhaps not too  surprising since the model was parameterized at low  pressures.) However, the application of the NMD  method [20,21] at high pressure has pointed to an  apparent shortcoming of the model, namely, the pres-  ence of a bcc phase. No analogous NMD calculations  have yet been reported for H^O or HF and it remains  to be seen whether or not the simple potentials pro-  posed recently [13,14] for these substances have a  wider applicability. This caveat notwithstanding, these  ample potential models appear to be-adequate for  simulations on the liquids.    582    Acknowledgement    We thank Bob Mills and J rgen Eckert for numer-  ous stimulating discussions on the subject of ammonia  and The Materials Research Centre at Los Alamos for  their support.

Account is taken of electron correlation. For short distances, three-body terms can be large, depen-  dent upon geometry, and although for distances greater than the van der Waals minimum these three-body terms are small,  their effect may still be of importance for dense fluids because of the number ratio of three- to two-body terms.    1. Introduction    The d termination of ground-state pair potentials  for the rare gases has received significant experimen-  tal and theoretical attention. Semi-empirical pair po-  tentials are known to high precision [1 ]. For many  experimental purposes it is necessary to know the  corresponding variation of pair polarizability a with  pair separation R ; for example, binary collision-  induced Raman spectra can be computed if the pair  potential and variation of a with R are known. Re-  cent work [2] has investigated the possibility of using  ab initio quantum-mechanical polarizabilities for this  purpose.    In the case of dense fluids, hov/ever, neither ener-  gy nor polarizability is necessarily pairwise additive.  Little is known in general either experimentally or  theoretically about deviations from pairwise additivi-  ty; most pair potentials are effective potentials which  absorb many-body effects, and calculations of a for    Permanent address: Department of Physical Chemistry,  University of Barcelona, Av Diagonal 645, Barcelona-28,  Spain.    ** Permanent address: Department of Chemistry, UMIST,  Manchester M60 1QD, UK.    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    He^ assume pairwise additivity [3]. SCF MO energy  calculations have been reported for He3, N03 and  Ar3 [4], from which it appears that the interaction  energy is dominated by pair terms around the van der  Waals minimum and at larger distances, but at close  separation this is no longer true. The SCF three-body  term depends upon geometric configurations, being  positive for linear and near-linear He-c dusters but  negative otherwise.    The aim of this paper is to give preliminary results  of an ab initio investigation into the pairwise additivi-  ty of polarizability in rare-gas mixtures- Specifically.  we investigate here three-body effects in He3 clusters.    2. Calculations    Meyer's atomic orbital set "D" [5] was used and  electron correlation was included explicitly by the  self-consistent electron-pairs [6] procedure ofDykstra  et al., which is almost equivalent to an all-singles-plus-  doubles CI calculation. Calculations were done part-  ly on a CDC 7600 at the University of Manchester  Regional Computer Center and partly on an IBM 3032    at Auburn University Computer Center. Polarizabili-  ties were calculated by the finite-field method of    583    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    Cohen and Roothaan (7], and the effect of basis set  superposition errors was investigated by the ghost-  orbital technique [8].    Probably the most accurate semi-empirical poten-  tial for He^ is the ESMSV II potential of Farrar and  Lse [9], which gives a minimum of 11.0   0.2 K  (0.152 X 10-21 J) at-Rm = 296.3   1.0 pm. Because  our primary concern is with polarizability we do not  present the potential energy results. We note, how-  ever; that the SCF pair potential has a spurious min-  imum of sal.5 X l0~^&gt; J around 420 pm which dis-  appears, giving a fully repulsive SCF curve, when al-  lowance is made for basis set superposition errors.  The SCEP potentials with and without superposition  corrections show moderate agreement with the highly  accurate ESMSV II potential; the SCEP curve has a  minimum of 0.11 X 10-21 J at 311 pm, the ghost-  orbital-corrected curve having a inininnnn of 0.10  X 10~21 J at 314 pm. Basis set superposition errors  are of the order of 10% in energy at distances greater  than the van der Waals minimum but are negligible  at short range-  The free-atom polarizability (XQ is calculated to be  1.2987 e2 a2 E^.at the SCF level and 1.3583 e2 a2  E^ at the SCEP level. Buckingham and Hibbard [10]  calculated a value of 1:38319 e1 fl2 E^1, which agrees  with the most accurate experimental value [11] after  allowance is made for the finite -mass "of the helium  nucleus on conversion to atomic units [12]. hi terms  of the parallel (an) and perpendicular (o^) diatom po-  larizabilities, the incremental pair polarizability Aofi^,  trace d^ and anisotropy pu  are defined as    ^^u-^o'    aW^Aa^+ZAap),    ^AaCT-Aap^a,,-^,    where the superscript (2) indicates an atom-pair in-  cremental property.

Two series of three-body calculations were per-  formed, corresponding to linear and isosceles tri-  angular geometries. Table 2 summarizes the SCEP  results for linear geometries, the SCF results being  almost identical. (Again, it is necessary to treat care-  fully the SCEP size consistency problem when sub-  tracting one- and two-body terms from He3 ; pseudo  one- and two-body terms with the other atom(s) re-  moved to a large distance (500 ffo) were used.) For  very small separations, typically 2 QQ, the three-body  contribution to a and   is no more than 10% and for  distances greater than the van der Waals minimum  the three-body terms are essentially zero. We there-  fore conclude that, m the linear case, three-body  terms are not important.    In the case of the isosceles triangular He^ configura-  tions, results for the three components of the in-  cremental polarizability tensor are shown in table 3.  Here the three-body terms are generally larger than  m the linear case; for very short distances the three-  body terms are as large as the elements of the incremen-  tal polarizability tensor, but at distances around the  van,der Waals minimum (300 pm) they are generally  less than 10% of the total and fall away rapidly to  zero.

Introduction    The impact of potential energy derivative studies  within such areas as molecular structure determina-  tion, vibrational spectroscopy, molecular dynamics,  and statistical rate theories is only beginning to be  realized. Statistical and/or dynamical models [1 5]  based upon ideas such as the reaction path hamil-  tonian [2] require in the simplest application, sec-  ond derivatives of the potential energy and in slight-  ly more refined versions, they require some limited  fourth derivative information [5] . The ultimate im-  pact of these models depends to some extent on the  availability of energy derivatives of various order for  reliable ab initio wavefunctions.    First derivatives of the Bom-Oppenheimer poten-  tial energy for Hartree Fock wavefunctions have  been available for quite some time now, and second  derivatives have been available for a few years [6,7] .  However, in order to investigate the broad regions  of the potential energy surface implicit in some of  the above applications, one needs a potential func-  tion which includes at least differentially, the effects  of electron correlation. There has been a great deal  of recent activity in potential energy derivative evalua-  tion for correlated wavefunctions. There now exist  codes which calculate analytically MC SCF second  derivatives [8 10], CI first derivatives based upon  a Hartree Fock reference function [11,12] or on    * NAS-NRC Research Associate.    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    a multiconfigurational reference function [10] and  CI second derivatives based upon a Hartree Fock  reference function [9] - Third derivative equations  have been published for various wavefunctions [13,  14] and one can expect to see the implimentation of  some of these equations in the not too distant future.    We address here an issue pertinent to the efficient  evaluation of any of these potential energy derivatives-  The derivatives of the energy are most tractably eval-  uated in a basis of cartesian displacements of the at-  oms in a molecule. There are 3N such displacements  where N is the number of atoms. Since the energy  is invariant to overall translations and rotations of  the molecule, the 3N elements of, for example, the  cartesian gradient vector are not all independent.  Given 3N   6 dements of the cartesian gradient vec-  tor, we show how one can generate the remaining six  elements by consideration of the rotational and trans-  lational invariance of the energy **. We also show how  the same ideas can be applied to the evaluation of  second and third cartesian derivatives yielding even  larger relative savings.    For the sake of simplicity, the discussion in the text im-  plicitly assumes a non-linear configuration of the mole-  cule. The arguments are fully applicable for a linear mole-  cule for which one angles out five cartesian directions in-  stead of six.    587    v    -t    Volume 104, number 6    2. Development    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    We denote the cartesian coordinates of a molecule  by the vector .x. Ifr, is a coordinate representing an  overall rotation or translation of the molecule (an :    "external" coordinate), then the change in cartesian  coordinates accompanying a displacement along r,  can be expressed as    x(r,) -x(r, = 0) = (ax/ar,)or,+ ^xl^rf + HOT    =V,-+--                              (1)    Here x(r, = 0) are the cartesian coordinates of the  reference geometry. Ifr, represents a translation of  the molecule, then the second- and higher-order terms  are zero and eq. (1) expresses a linear transformation.  If rf is a rotation, all tenns contribute to the sum,    The energy is invariant to external displacements,    E(r-) = constant.    (2)    Differentiating eq. (2) with respect to r, and eval-  uating the result at r, = 0 yields directly a relation-  ship among the components of the cartesian gradient  vector,    3A'  [d -(r,)/dr,] ^ = 2) (df/dx? d^./dr, = L^g = 0, (3)    where g is the gradient vector in cartesian coordinates.  There are six such equations corresponding to the six  external directions r,, i = 1,6. Taken together, they  constitute a linear system of equations of order six  for which the unknowns are six components of the  cartesian gradient vector,    T.L    }=t    i=l,6.    where    ^jl^--    (4)    (5)    Eq. (4) is the working equation for gradient calcula-  tions. Care must be taken such that the six cartesian  directions separated out in eq. (4) are linearly inde-  pendent, otherwise the matrix of coefficients is sin-  gular and the solution undefined *.    588    A useful relationship similar to eq. (4) can be ob-  tained for each row or column of the cartesian sec-  ond derivative matrix by differentiating eq. (3) with  respect to a cartesian displacement,    (6)    In this equation,^ is the kth row or column of the  cartesian second derivative matrix and    r^=8( ,J/a^.                       (7)    There are six of these equations just as in the gradient  case. Casting this equation in the same working form  as eq. (4), the vector F^ takes the place of g' and the  right-hand side now has added tu it the second (gra-  dient dependent) term,    ^'^F.^-b'^ i-=l,6,    /=1  with    "/-,/,- f.k    3n            3n    ^^W^^r    (8)    (9)    It is interesting to note that Ly. is an eigenvector of  F, with eigenvalue zero only ifthe second term m  eq. (6) is zero. This is always true for translations  since in this case T^= 0. For rotations, this is the case  if the gradient is zero, i.e. at a stationary point.    The extension to third derivatives is straightforward.  Eq. (3) is differentiated with respect to two cartesian  components x^,X{ to obtain relationships among the  elements of the vector Gy, where    ^i^^W^-                  0 )    One obtains    ^ &lt;^ + r^ ^ + &lt; ^ + ^ = 0.    or  6    S    L.G^-b , ,=1,6.

(12) can then be solved for  each k, I pair.    3. Implementation    As previously mentioned, the six cartesian direc-  tions which are separated out must not be linearly  dependent. To ensure this, we choose them as all  three components of one atom, two components of  a second atom and one component of a third atom  which is not collinear with the  rst two atoms.    The three vectors  -. corresponding to translations  can be chosen as normaSized translational vectors m  the three cartesian directions- The other three vec-  tors can be chosen as rotational vectors about any  three linearly independent axes. For convenience, we  choose these to be the cartesian axes. Thus to first  order, a rotation about the z axis for example is a  cartesian vector for which they component on each  atom is proportional to ihex coordinate ofthat at-  om and the x component is proportional to the nega-  tive of the y coordinate- Three such vectors are form-  ed and subsequently Schmidt orth.ogon.ali.zed to the  translations-Th&amp; result is three first-order rotations  in the cartesian planes- Infinitesimal displacements  along the direction of these vectors correspond to  infinitesimal rotations of the molecule.    The T^ is the derivative of the external vector  -    'i                                                                                                     ' f    with respect to a cartesian displacement and can be  readily generated by a finite difference procedure,    T^ = (l/2o)[ ^ + 8) - ^k - 5)!         &lt;15)  The T^.'1 can be generated similarly.    Using the procedure outlined above, one can ig-  nore six of the cartesian directions in derivative evalu-  ations. These components are calculated from the  others by a simple procedure at the end of the cal-  culation. It is worthwhile to examine, for a few spe-  cific cases, just what computation is bypassed by  using this technique.    The most straightforward derivatives to evaluate  are those based upon wavefunctions which are deter-  mined variationally. Recognizing the stationary con-  dition with respect to the variational parameters, one  can avoid the derivatives of variational parameters  with respect to nudear coordinates. The difficult  step in SCF and MC SCF first derivative calculations  arises through the dependence of the energy on the  positions of the basis functions: the evaluation of  the derivatives of the two-electron integrals with re-  spect to nudear coordinates. Using the technique  presented here, one can select six directions for which  derivatives of the integrals need not be calculated.  Since the translational invariance of the integrals them-  selves is exploited in most derivative integral com-  puter programs [l 6J. the actual savings one can ex-  pect comes from the neglect of three cartesian direc-  tions * - One can choose these components to be on  the atoms having the largest number of basis func-  tions and therefore affect the largest number of in-  tegrals.-    Gradients for Cl wavefunctions based upon SCF  or MC SCF orbitais and second or third derivative for  SCF or MC SCF wavefunctions require the first-order  response of the SCF or MC SCF variational param-  eters to nuclear displacenients. This leads for each  eartesia  aapias&amp;Hient, to    &amp; evaluation of a   nea   system of equations, the order of which is the num-  ber of variational parameters- Solving these coupled  perturbed Hartree Fock or MC SCF equations can  become a time consuming step in these calculations.  Six of these linear systems can be avoided.    Rotational relationships among the two electron integrals  can also be used m integral first derivative evaluation. How-  ever. considering the complexity of the implementation in  conjunction with the number of operations required to  solve the equations versus solving the integrals themselves,  this is not generally done.    589    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    CI second derivatives and MC SCF or SCF fourth  derivatives require the second-order changes in the  SCF or MC SCF variational parameters. This leads to  a linear system of equations for each pair of cartesian  coordinates. One need solve only |(3AT - 6) (3N  5)  instead o!^(3N) (3AT+ l) sets of linear equations.  CI second derivatives have the addtional time con-  suming step of solving the coupled perturbed CI equa-  tions. This requires an integral transformation and  solving a linear set of equations, the order of which  is the number of CI coefficients. Thus, the solution  of the coupled perturbed CI equations for each car-  tesian coordinate is approximately equivalent to the  evaluation of the original CI wavefunction. For rela-  tively small systems, avoiding six of these coordinates  yields a significant reduction in computer time.    The emphasis in this discussion has been on the  application of the described technique to analytical  derivative evaluations. This is because there is a great  deal of current activity in this area. One can also ap-  ply this scheme to derivatives calculated by finite  difference procedures.    In summary, we have presented equations express-  ing the interrelationships among the cartesian deriva-  tives of the Bom Oppenheimer potential energy.  These relationships are derived from the invariance  of the energy to overall rotations and translations of  a molecule. We show how the energy invariance can  be used to reduce the computational effort for vari-  ous derivative calculations. Finally it is emphasized  that these equations are both simple to implement  and themselves require negligible computational labor.    590    References    [1] D.O. Truhlar and B.C.

SCHMIDT    Institute for Physical Chemistry. Technical University.Petersenstrasse20.D-6100 Darmstadt. West Germany    Received 24 November 1983; in final form 16 December 1983    A measure of phase space delocalization for the eigenfunctions of regular and irregular eigenstates of a bound hanulto-  nian is introduced on the basis of a smoothed Wigner distribution function and a phase space graining. This measure, which  is an entropy-like quantity, shows a large dispersion as a function of energy above and below the critical energy Ec for clas-  sically chaotic motion. It is conjectured that many chaotic states also show properties of regular states 100-    Vibrational energy transfer in molecules, as well  as the vibrational structure of molecular spectra, are  closely related to non-linear intermode vibrational  coupling [1,2]. As in the classical case [1 3],this  coupling leads to an approach to two kinds of beha-  viour: regular and irregular quantum states- Both the  energy spectrum and the properties of the individual  eigenfunctions differ quantitively between regular  and irregular states. In the semiclassical limit (fi -&gt; 0),  regular wavef nctions correspond to a classical mo-  tion on a torus while irregular quantum states do not  [3,4]. While the distribution P(s) of spacings between  neighbouring energy levels follows a Wigner Dyson  distribution P(s) = As exp ( as2) for the irregular  spectrum, a simple exponential relation P(s) cc  exp ( as) is found for the regular spectrum [5] . For  systems with a smooth transition between classically  regular and irregular motion a distribution PCs) oc  s'? exp( as1'^) can be observed in which q increases  monotonically with energy (0 'S q &lt; 1) [6].    In molecular vibrational systems the limit Ti -&gt;  0 is  generally not valid and a clear classi cation of the  quantum states becomes problematic. Even if there is  some possibility of matching a given eigenstate of a  non-separable system with an eigenstate of an inte-  grable hamiltonian by an overlap S &gt; 0.5 to one of  the eigenfunctions of the latter [7,8], this gives no  quantitative measure of regularity. The overlap crite-  rion only tells that there is a regular state with at least    fifty percent overlap with the quantum state under  consideration but the correspondence is not unique.  Consequently, the actual value of S cannot be taken  as a quantitative measure of irregularity or delocaliza-  tion of a wavefunction.    In this paper we suggest a measure of delocaliza-  tion of individual eigenfunctions of a bound hamilto-  nian which is closely related to the phase space inter-  pretation of this function and thus related to the cor-  responding classical motion. It has been demonstrated  by Berry [4] that regular and irregular eigenfunctions  behave quite differently in the semiclassical limit fi -    0. In this limit quantum energy eigenstates fall into  two universality classes distinguished by the morphol-  ogy of their wavef nctions. States in the regular  spectrum, associated with tori in classical phase space,  have vivid patterns of regular interference fringes and  violent fluctuations in intensity associated with caus-  tics of the classical motion. Contrarily, states in the  irregular spectrum, associated with stochastic motion  in phase space, have random pattern of interference  maxima with more temperate intensity fluctuations    and anticaustics at boundaries of the classical motion.  In the "ergodic" case the latter fluctuations should  be statistically isotropic over the accessible space.    The conventional tool for analyzing a quantum-  mechanical wavefunction ^( ) = &lt; l^)with respect  to local properties in phase space is the Wigner distri-  bution function [3,4,9]    591    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    f( ,p)=h-^fdxexp(-p'x{n)^*(9-^x)^(gHx)  = h-^ fdxexp(-p-JC/^)&lt;?+^x|^&gt;&lt;4'| - 3c&gt; -    0)    This function, which approaches the classical phase  space density function in the classical limit of quan-  tum mechamcs.has been used by.some authors [1,3,  4,10] for a qualitative analysis of the wavefunction's  properties. P(y,p) shows sharp edges for regular  wavefuneti&amp;ns (eo-nespondsig t&amp; th&amp; caustics for the  classical motion on a torus) and delocalized behaviour  for those eigenfunctions which do not correspond to  a regular motion in the classical limit, but all kinds of  transition behaviour between both types can also be  observed. This gradual change cannot be easily de-  scribed on the basis ofaWigner distribution function  analysis since this function cannot be interpreted as a  probability density because it is not positive definite.  One can however circumvent this difficulty by con-  sidering a phase-space-smoothed Wigner distribution  since those areas where P(q,p) takes negative values  are small with respect to a volume in phase space of  the order of k^. We take a gaussian smoothing proce-  dure, which averages the fluctuations ofP(q,p) with-  in such an area by introducing the distribution    Q(q,p)= ^ffdg ap'P(f.p)    Jv  X n exp lw?tu?(g,- - qyiK + (p, -py/m^Ti],    1=1                                     (2)  where q,,pi are components of the position and the  momentum, respectively, and m, are the corresponding  masses. The frequencies GS{ are free parameters which  are chosen here as the angular frequencies of some  normal modes which can be derived from the second-  order expansion of the potential energy at the equilib-  rium position of the vibrational system. The widths  of the individual gaussians m eq. (2) m momentum  and position space respectively are given by    ojc=w,-u,K, a^^nim^,                  (3)    leading to a product of OpjOq^ =  ft which is the posi-  tion momentum uncertainty product ApjAq^ of a  minimum uncertainty wave packet (harmonic oscilla-  tor coherent state, HOCS). Indeed it can be shown    592    [11,12] that Q(ff,p) is equivalent to the projection  of the considered eigenstate ^(c) on a HOCS centered  in phase space at position (c, p),    (4)    and it is clear that Q(fl,p) is positive definite. The  harmonic oscillator coherent states can be defined in  three different ways.

The use of Q(q, p) instead of the original Wigner  distribution for a phase space interpretation of the  wavefunction was introduced by other authors [13].    A qualitative discussion ofQ(q,p) for a two-di-  mensional non-linearly coupled oscillator was recently  presented by Weissman and Jortner [13] but these  authors did not discuss a quantitative measure of de-  localization. Such a quantitative measure can be in-  troduced by considering mformation-entropy-like  quantities. It has been demonstrated [14,15] that the  HOCS can be interpreted as representative wave  packets for a single phase space cell. As these cells  cover a volume ofh^ in phase space, a discrete set of  HOCS is sufficient to represent the whole phase space.  As before [14,15] we use HOCSs located on a von  Neumann lattice which in one-dimension takes the  form    CL-Jfc = (muslin)1!2 \qQ) +ip(fc)/ww] =^^2(f+ik),    (7)    with integersJ, k.

The set { IQ,^): /, k ^ 0,0} forms a complete but non-  orthogonal Hubert space basis [16]. Therefore the  Q.^ cannot be interpreted as matrix elements of a    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 Februar}' 1984    a density operator in a diagonal representation.  Nevertheless the distribution of them over the acces-  sible phase space of the wavefunctions ' I'' can be used  to-   isasare  he relative aa-iouiri &amp;f del&amp;calaati&amp;n and  so to compare wavefunctions in a certain energy  range. If there are as many Q.^ of the same order of  magnitude as phase space cells cut by the H=E energy  surface the function can be assigned to be irregular.    We introduce an entropy-like quantity for a quan-  titative measure of this delocalization:    (9)    where now (i is a vector index with integer compo-  nents.

The procedure described above was applied to  two-dimensional model systems for which the eigen-  functions are calculated with a variational scheme  with respect to a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator  basis. The model hamiltonians can be given in gener-  alized coordinates (fi = 1, c^ = 1, m = 1) as    A: ^/ o=e(pj+p|+^+g|)  + 0.10616(g^,--^1).    B: . / c^eo^+pl+ci+i-igs)    +0.1089( ^2-i| |).

The S^ values are much lower than the  classical ergodic limit entropy S^. The latter was cal-  culated with the same phase space graining as was  used for the von Neumann lattice [15]. This ergodic  limit entropy can be roughly used as an estimate for  an upper bound of quantum information entropies, as  demonstrated recently by Brickmann et al. [15].  There is no qualitative change in the delocalization  behaviour of the eigenfunction of both hamiltonians  going from the classical regular to the irregular energy  range. For low energies the eigenvalues form groups  of close-lying values. Within one group the delocaliza-  tion passes through a maximum located in the energy  center of the group and decreases with increasing and  decreasing energy- This effect is very pronounced in  model B where the delocalization changes very regu-  larly in each group (see fig. 2b). In the high-energy  range the groups of eigenvalues turn to overlap- This  overlap, however, does not influence the general de-  localization behaviour very much. Again we find a  large dispersion in ST) for eigenstates with adjacent  eigenvalues, but states with high delocalization appear  more frequently with increasing energy. This can be  seen from fig. 3 where the ratio of "local" states (SQ  values with Sp &lt; i (S^^ + S^ ) to all S^ values)  in an energy range offio  are drawn. S^^ and S^1^  are the maximum and minimum delocalization values  in the energy range. These values were determined  from the envelope curves in fig. 2. We conclude from  our treatment that there is no abrupt change between    593    Volume 104, number 6    5.50    CHEMICAL PHYSICS lETTERS    - 24 February 1984          60         9.0  ENERGY    150          &lt;n  4.00    6.0         9.0  ENERGY    15.0 -    Fig. 2.

Introduction: formulae for spectroscopic parameters    According to Dunham [1], a Bom Oppenheimer (BO) potential function of a diatomic molecule is usually  given as a power series expansion in the coordinate   = (r   r^jr^:    ^-o^J?^")-    Spectroscopic constants 1- involved in the formula    EVJ = E V" + \l2)m w -1- W    mf    (1)    (2)    for vibration rotation energies include Born Oppenheimer, adiabatic and non-adiabatic corrections, dependent  on the nuclear massesAf^ andAfg and the electronic mass m^.

The theoretical derivation ofisotopic relations for Y^.  was discussed by Bunker [3] and Watson [4], and eq. (3) was rigorously justified in r f. [5].    Formulae for Y^y in terms of parameters a,, of a BO potential (1) were derived by Dunham [1 ], Sandeman  [6],Thomas [7],Wolley [8],Tipping [9], Galin et al. [10] andBouanich [11].

The SACD, described in refs.  [12 14], is based on successive contact transformations of the molecular hamiltonian. Computer programs in-  volved in the SACD select possible combinations ^(a^ a',2 ...a'") of molecular parameters which contribute to  a given V^P and calculate the associated weight factor K,.. The characteristics of the set of formulae (4) derived  using the SACD are presented in table 1. The list of associated Y^ is given in r f. [13] , and complete tables for  K. weight factors including all corrections in eq- (4) up to-/v'&lt; 10 are presented in r f. [10] **. The validity of  these formulae was verified by numerical tests with Kratzer and Morse potentials [15] - However, most of these  formulae were not really employed due to a lack of experimental information. Recently, Guelachvili et al. [ 6]  deduced from the high-resolution infrared spectrum an extensive set of y ,. for CO. This makes it possible to in-  volve many of these formuale in a least-squares fit of the adiabatic Dunham potential function [17].    Using the SACD, the authors derived t formulae (4) (with the same characteristics as in table 1) for expansions  of the potential functions suggested by Simons, Parr and Finlan (SPF) [18], Ogilvie and Tipping (OT) [19] and  Thakkar (T) [20]. In this article, we discuss the inverse of these formulae, which provide dosed formulae for BO  parameters fl,D &gt;fl,^PF.a^ and a  in terms of the constants U^., as well as exact relations between the U^,- with  application to the CO molecule.    2. Anharmonic parameters as functions of U^Q, U^    There are known representations [18 20] of the potential function which have a more consistent asymptotic  behaviour. They may be unified by eq. (1), where the variable  , is not a polynomial in the internudear distance r:    SPF expansion:  ,=(r- r^)/r;     OT expansion:   = 1(r - r )/(r + r)-.    T expansion:   = sign(p) [1 - (rJr)P~[.                                                                 (5)    These representations provide better convergence [22] of expansion (1) and much better stability [23] of calcu-  lations using eq. (4) compared to the polynomial Dunham representation.    The usual way of calculating the potential function is by fitting eq. (4) to " experimental" Y^. [24,17]. Note  that eqs. (4) for   y- are infinite expansions which must be truncated in a fit IT . There are non-adiabatic con-  tributions to y y-, which are not taken into account by eqs. (4). This results in additional errors in the potential  function (1) apart from the effect of uncertainties of "experimental"   .    We would like to pay attention to the possibility of avoiding this kind of error by the use of relations c  =  fl (t^ .), which have closed form. Indeed, any of the isotopically invariant constants  / ,,- is a finite polynomial    In refs.

(7) and (8)  does not require a least-squares fit: only simple arithmetic operations are needed. With the tables ofT?01) y weight    factors kept in computer memory, these calculations are straightforward. A numerical illustration for the CO  molecule, with input values of the t/ y- parameters from r f. [16], is given in table 3.    The Dunham parameters up to a0 in table 3 are in agreement (although they do not coincide exactly) with  those calculated by a least-squares fit [24,17] using eqs. (4). For a^, there is a relative discrepancy with the value  of r f. [17] of 14%; fora^ the discrepancy is 44% and so on.    The differences may be explained by the influence ofadiabatic corrections to a^, implicitly taken into account  m r f. [17] , and by large uncertainties in the high-order ff . Poorly defined parameters flg to a^Q are included in  table 3 for reasons discussed in section 7.    3. Exact relations among U^,.

Discussion    Relations (7), (8), (l 1) and (12) enable one to deduce true Bom Oppenheimer anharmonicity parameters by  easy algebraic calculations provided physically meaningful values of U^. parameters are available- Numerical illu-  strations for the CO molecule are given in tables 3 and 5. These tables show the values ofa^ to a^o if one substi-  tutes in the exact relations (7), (8), (11) and (12) the most extensive set of fitted t/n  values by Guelachvili et al.  [l 6] . However, there are always differences between fitted and physically meaningful values of spectroscopic pa-  rameters, and this is valid for the U^ values of r f. [16] as well. To examine these differences, one can use the  exact relations (9) and (10) or (13)-(15) as possible tests. Tables 4 and 6 show that the low-order parameters U'    of r f. [16], with a reasonable accuracy, obey these relations whereas for high-order parameters the differences  appear rather large. These differences disturb resulting high-order parameters a  also, as is dear from comparison  of tables 3 and 5.    Some comments have to be made on the statistical analysis. Since a correlation matrix of fitted U' - and A^,-  parameters is not presented in the paper of Guelachvili et al. [16], we have used the diagonal correction matrix  in our error propagation analysis. It is clear that some of the U' - parameters should be strongly correlated; there-  fore, standard deviations given m parentheses in tables 3 6 must be considered as preliminary estimates. This is  one "of the reasons why we include the parameters flg to a^y in table 3, although they have large uncertainties. An-  other reason is that the later entries of tables 3 and 5 demonstrate what information on a potential function mav  be deduced from the most extensive set of fitted U^. values, and so give an idea of the required accuracy ofin-    + However, in this case. t/^ and U^Q were deduced from vibration rotation spectra.    603    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    put U^  values. Since the a  in tables 3 and 5 are calculated using closed relations, the only origin of uncertainties  in ff  are uncertainties in fitted U^,. parameters.    Although the choice of the subset { ^n,}, is somewhat arbitrary, the resulting algebraic relations among (J^,.  are mathematically equivalent for any choice of { ^,,}  - Relations (9) and (13) are in fact the same relations  written in different forms..    In order to deduce a more consistent set of (/  - and A- parameters and to recover a unique potential func-  tion, one may apply the equations of sections 3,5 and 6 as-constraints in the procedure of a fit of experimental  data. Contrary to the above case (tables 3 and 5), thee  values will be independent of the choice of the input  subset {u,,;,},. In fact such a  t is equivalent to a direct non-linear fit of a BO potential function to vibration-  rotation transitions, although utilizing simpler explicit relations among l/   instead of implicit relations.

Introduction    Since early reports on the possibility of obtaining  large single crystals of polymers by solid-state poly-  merization of substituted diacetylenes [1], this group  of organic solids has attracted much attention. Among  them, bis(p-toluene sulphonate) of2,4-hexadiyne-l,6-  diol (hereafter abbreviated pTS) has been the most  extensively studied, and a substantial amount of ex-  perimental data concerning its physical and chemical  properties have been accumulated (see, for example,  rets. [2 4] for reviews).    pTS,when annealed above room temperature and  below its melting point (92 C), polymerizes homo-  geneously, forming monomer polymer solid solutions  over all the polymer concentration range (see, for ex-  ample, r f. [4], and references therein). Monomer  and polymer crystals both undergo a phase transition  below room temperature, with a doubling of the unit  cell asso dated with immobilization of the side groups  in two non-equivalent positions [5 7]. While poly-  mer crystals go directly from the room-temperature  to the low-temperature phase at 190 K, monomer  crystals containing ^10% polymer show an interme-  diate, in commensurably modulated phase between    On leave from the Institute of Organic and Physical Chem-  istry, Technical University of Wroclaw, 50-370 Wroclaw,  Poland.    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B-V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    about 200 and 160 K [8 11]. The crystal structures  of all commensurate phases have been determined  [8,12 14] ;it was established that all belong to the  monodinic space group P2]/c with molecules located  at the particular positions, and are hence centrosym-  metric.    In spite of this, pyroelectricity   a phenomenon  that can be observed in crystals whose structures lack  an inversion centre   was reported botli in pure poly-  mer [15,16] and monomer [16] crystals, as well  as in the mixed crystals [16] - Xiao, Ando and Bloor  [16] (hereafter referred to as XAB), who studied the  pyroelectric response of pTS as a function of ihe de-  gree of polymerization, suggested that the origins of  the effects m monomer and polymer crystals are of  a different nature- Indeed, the current measured by  XAB may be approximated by a superposition of nar-  row signals appearing in the vicinities of the phase-  transition temperatures and a broad background, its  magnitude increasing as the monomer-to-polymer con-  version degree increases. The latter was attributed 10  a macroscopic deformation of polymer crystals, its  origin, however, remaining obscure-  The results presented in this paper are comple-  mentary to those reported by XAB, and, we believe,  offer an explanation as to the origin of the pyroelec-  tric signal in poly-pTS crystals. We describe here an  electric current generated in pTS during the isother-  mal polymerization, and put forward an explanation  of the effect observed.    605    Volume 104, number 6    2. Experimental    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    The crystals used in the experiments were grown  from an acetone solution at 4 C; the procedures for  synthesis of materials and crystal growth are described  in details elsewhere [17,18].    Our experiments were in their major part carried  out on samples with the Ag electrodes pasted on their  (ac) faces, i.e. the direction of growing polymer chains  was perpendicular to the electrodes. These samples  were cut from the solution-grown crystals and polish-  ed on acetone-soaked tissues; they were typically  I  mm thick, their electroded areas being of the order  of 10 nun2. Some of the measurements were perform-  ed on samples with electrodes on their natural cleav-  age (be) planes; in these cases, the areas were ss2 5  times larger, the thickness remaining approximately  the same.    The samples, provided with electrodes, were  mounted on a massive grounded brass support, and  the upper electrode was connected to a Keithley  610 B electrometer followed by a recorder. The sup-  port could be maintained at a constant temperature;    the experimental cell could be additionally heated  by an independent heater to minimize temperature  gradients across the samples. The temperature of the  upper surface of the sample and that of the support  were measured with two independent thermocouples.  As a rule, both temperatures were constant and iden-  tical to within l K after equilibrium had been reach-  ed. To maximize the magnitude of the effect, the  measurements were carried out at 350   l K. The  time necessary to reach equilibrium at this tempera-  ture was typically 20 min; it is important to men-  tion that at shorter times the samples were subject  to temperature gradients as large as several K.    Measurements were carried out in the current  mode, i.e. the samples were short-circuited through  the electrometer resistance (usually 109 or 1010 n;    there was no change of the signal on changing the  resistance). The measured currents were of the order  of 10-12-10-11 A.    3.

The curves in (b) have been  normalized to maximum values of the polarization P =J"^/dr/  f^max / dr. For the sake of clarity, all curves have been ver-  tically shifted. The dot-dashed curve in (b) is the conversion  UO-time dependence as determined from calorimetric mea-  surements at 353 K (cf. r f. [18]).    iflar to the b direction and annealed at 350 K. A sig-  nal was always observed around the time interval  where on the basis of previous measurements (cf. rets.  [17 21]) one should expect a maximum monomer-  to-polymer conversion rate. The smooth changes of  the currents were usually accompanied by spikes (not  shown in fig. la), probably due to creation and/or  annihilation of defects. The currents   although dif-  fering in details of their time dependences   were  quite reproducible in general features. It should be  noted that we always observed negative currents,    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    usually being of the order of lO-^ lO-11 A.    As mentioned above, we also carried out measure-  ments on samples with electrodes on their (be) planes.  The signals measured in this case were smaller by at  least one order of magnitude than tliose observed  along the b direction.    The results of structural studies, quoted earlier  in this paper, clearly show that pTS is centrosym-  metric everywhere except for the temperature and  composition range where the incommensurate phase  exists; the symmetry thus forbids a spontaneous po-  larization to be generated in the crystals. Yet, the re-  sults presented here demonstrate that a non-zero po-  larization builds up in the pTS samples during the  polymerization, its magnitude being proportional to  the conversion degree (compare the curves in fig. Ib).  The polarization is therefore likely to be associated  with the generation of polar species during the solid-  state reaction. We shall return to this point later in  this paper. It should be noted, however, that the pres-  ense of these polar spedes does not suffice for the  polarization to be built up in the samples: the dipoles  should be oriented in such a way so as to avoid can-  celling of their electrical moments. The sign of the  currents observed   permanently negative   indicates  that the orientation is due to an external "driving  force", most probably temperature gradients, in-  evitably present in our samples during the measure-  ments (although efforts were made to minimze them),  and influencing to even a greater degree non-isother-  mal measurements such as those of pyroelectric or  thermally stimulated currents [22].    The influence of the temperature distribution in  our measuring cell on the electrical signal was con-  firmed in the following experiment. A sample was  mounted in the cell in the usual manner and anneal-  ed at 350 K until the beginning of the autocatalytic  period, i.e. until the onset of the negative current  usually observed in such cases. The cell was then open-  ed, the crystal turned "upside-down", and the an-  nealing continued. The current measured was found  to be much smaller, and mostly positive, thus indi-  cating that the orientation of polar spedes during  the polymerization is influenced by the temperature  distribution.    As mentioned above, the measured currents were  largest along the b direction of the crystals, and there-  fore one may suppose that either the polar species    formed during the polymerization are preferentially  oriented along that direction or they are oriented in  such a way that their electrical moments cancel in all  but the b direction. Our results do not allow us to  draw any conclusion as to their nature and precise  orientations. One may speculate that the strain gen-  erated during the polymerization gives rise to small  deviations of arrangements of the side groups. The  dipole moments of these groups amount to s=4 5 D  [23], and hence it is straightforward to estimate that  deviations of the order of less than l min of arc are  sufficient to give rise to a polarization of the order  oflO^C/m2.    Alternatively, one may suppose that these species  are likely to be associated with chain ends oriented  in such a way as to yield a non-compensated moment  along the b direction. Obviously, the maximum mo-  ment per unit cell cannot exceed an arithmetic sum  of the moments of all polar groups in the cell. Based  on that assumption and further assuming their mo-  ment to be equal to that of a tosyi group, one can  estimate the concentration of dipoles and hence the  average chain length. One must stress that the chain  length found in such a way is very likely to be over-  estimated because perfect orientation of the dipoles  is rather unlikely.    The average value of the polarization was deter-  mined from our measurements to be 4.5 X 10 l C/  m2, i.e. the concentration of dipoles in our samples  amounts to at least 3 X 1025 m-3. assuming their  electrical moment to be equal to that of the tosyi  group. Hence one can estimate the average length of  the polymer chains formed in our experiments to be  of the order of a couple of hundred of monomer units  at most (^700 A). Therefore, our results agree with  the values given by Patel [24] and Albouy et al- [25]  rather than with those published by Mondong and  B ssler [26]. Chance et al. [27] and Enkelman et al.  [8] . It should be kept in mind lhat our estimate is  based on measurements of currents carried out in the  course of the polymerization, the predominant con-  tribution coming from the effect measured in the  autocatalytic period, and hence reflecting the situa-  tion in samples, in which the conversion is far from  being complete. Our result should therefore be con-  sidered as an average chain length in partly polymer-  ized pTS, rather than in pure poly-pTS crystals.    607    Volume 104, number 6    Acknowledgement    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    We thank Dr. J.L.

USA    Received 12 October 1983; in final form 2 December 1983    We discuss the superiority of the tune-correlator approach over conventional sum-over-states methods for exact multi-  mode modeling of T ^ 0 K optical absorption and resonance Raman profiles. Numerical illustrations of thermal broadening  are given, and a short-time approximation is shown to be very convenient for modeling this effect.    1. Introduction    Model calculations of optical absorption spectra  and resonance Raman (RR) profiles are important in  the study of the electronic vibrational coupling m  both molecules and in solid-state impurity systems- It  is common to perform these calculations by explicitly  summing vibrational overlap integrals over intermedi-  ate vibrational states (the sum-over-states method), as-  suming a phenomenological homogeneous width F  (hwhm) &gt; 100 cm"1. For multimode systems, this ap-  proach is problematic in two respects: (1) niultimode  effects are difficult to treat because the sum-over-  states method is too time-consuming for exact ^V-mode  (W&lt;; 10) model calculations, even at T= 0 K, and (2)  for systems whose optical absorption spectra and RR  profiles are mainly broadened by homogeneous multi-  mode effects, the computational difficulty of treating  thes&amp; effects asesssi s ss  h&amp; ass &amp;f widths r &gt;  O    cm"1. Such large widths correspond to effective elec-  tronic excited state lifetimes  &lt; 1 ps, which are unreal-  istically short for this class of systems-  Regarding the first of these problems, Tannor and  Heller [1] showed that their 3"= 0 K semiclassical  modeling procedure based on Fourier transforms is  more efficient for multimode systems than is the sum-  over-states method. Although the Tannor Heller ap-  proach also offers a partial (i.e T = 0 K) solution of    * Work supported by National Science Foundation Grant  DMR 8204586.    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    the second problem, namely that of unrealistic widths.  a complete solution for T^ 0 K requires the addition  of thermal broadening effects due to low-frequency  thermally populated modes. This could be done, in  principle, by Boltzmann averaging over the numerous  initial vibrational states of such modes. However, such  a brute-force approach is obviously cumbersome for  multimode systems.    In this letter, we point out that within the time-cor-  relator theoretical framework [2,3] ofRR scattering  and optical absorption, (1) multimode modeling of the  optical absorption for arbitrary temperatures is both  efficient and exact, and (2) for a broad class of mulii-  mode systems T = 0 K modeling ofRR profiles is  equally simple. Moreover, we demonstrate how ther-  mal broadening due to a reservoir of low-frequency  modes may be conveniently treated in a short-time ap-  proximation of the exact time-correlator model expres-  s &amp;ns.   rf O R&amp;geneous broadening due-1&amp; scat erer       different local environments will not be considered.    2. Theory    2.1. Time-correlator approach for efficient T ^ O K.  multimode modeling    For simplicity, we will work within the "standard"  assumptions listed below, although many of the fea-  tures to be brought out can be shown to apply under  more general conditions. For instance, we will discuss    609    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    here effects on numerical calculations of generalizing  assumption (4) below to include quadratic electron   phonon coupling. The standard assumptions are: (1)  the sdiabatic and Condon approximations, (2) the har-  monic approximation for the vibrations (phonons),  (3) a single electronic excited state, and (4) linear elec-  tron phonon coupling. The latter produces atomic  equilibrium position shifts under electronic excitation.  The number of modes is arbitrary.  - For T^- 0 K and incident light frequency AJ^, the  optical absorption a((*&gt;^) is given by (see, for instance,  r f. [3])    a(w^)= Vw^ Im ^(u^),    (1)    where '13 is a temperature-independent constant. The  function    ^("L) = iJ ^ exp(ito,/ - 70 Ti(t)           (2)    0    is proportional to the resonant part of the complex sus-  ceptibility associated with the electronic transition.  The natural width is denoted by f, and  f(t) is the opti-  cal absorption time correlator &lt;5^(r)&gt; of refs. [2,3] :    The intensity of first-order RR Stokes scattering by  mode/may be written in terms of  (r) as [3]    '/("L)= c^ -K"^) "L"!

The constant Cis independent oft0i_,  60s, and/. With n(r) and pf(t) known, both (2) and (3)  are conveniently computed via owe-dimensional fast  Fourier transform (FFT) techniques.    The exact T^ 0 K model expressions for  n(t) and  pf(t) are very simple (see, for instance, refs. [3,4] ).  The expressions are    T)(t) = exp(-ic^r) exp ( - SXy{(2&lt;n^&gt; + 1)  X [1 -cos(d3ft)} -Hsm(wft)n    and    /y(f&gt;= - \}12 [  - exp(-i&lt;y)l.  Here the Stokes loss parameter Ay= Z.^(fitdf)~2,    (4)    (5)  where    610    Z r is the linear electron phonon coupling coefficient.  The quantity (i?^ is the zero-phonon transition frequen-  cy. Eqs. (2), (3), and (5) may be combined to yield     y(uL) = C(l + (nf)) coL&lt;4 \f |A(t^) $("L)12. (6)    where the difference operator ^(wf) is def ned by  A(( y) &lt;&amp;(tJL) = $(CUL)   * &gt;(( ;L - My). Eq. (6) was  given in r f. [2]. It is the basis of the transform meth-  ods detailed and extended in refs. [4,5], and references  therein-    It is seen from eqs. (4) and (5) that exact T^ 0 K  ((iif)^ 0) calculations are just as simple as their T= 0  K counterparts. Moreover, rigorous multimode calcula-  tions are easy since only a single sum over the modes  appears in eq. (4). This implies that the computing  time for T ^ 0 K multimode modeling increases rough-  ly as N for a large ^V-mode system. In contrast, the com-  puting time associated with summing overlap integrals  over n, vibrational levels of the electronic excited state  for r= 0 K increases roughly as (n^^-N, for large  N. Moreover, for T ^ 0 K, if the modes are highly ther-  mally populated, the large number of initial vibrational  states m, must also be included. The brute-force meth-  od of Boltzmann averaging over the initial vibrational  states would then become intractable since the com-  puting time would increase roughly as ( n, ,)^ 'SS&gt;N.    Although these considerations are based upon the  standard assumptions, eqs. (1) (3) remain exact when  assumption (4) is expanded to include arbitrary qua-  dratic as well as linear electron phonon coupling [6].  In this case, normal mode frequency shifts, normal co-  ordinate changes ("mode mixing") and equilibrium  position changes with electronic excitation are all in-  cluded, and the exact expressions [6] for ri(f) and Pf(f)  are more complicated than their standard assumptions  versions, eqs. (4) and (5). Nevertheless, they are straight-  forward to compute. The point of interest here is that  for anA^-mode system at any temperature, the numerical  evaluation of these formulas involves multiplications  and inversions of NX N symmetric matrices. As a re-  sult, the computing time increases roughly asJV3  &lt; (CTj-n,)^', for large N. With no mode mixing, but  with arbitrary frequency shifts and equilibrium posi-  tion changes included, the matrices in i (f) and py(0  become diagonal, and the computing time again in-  creases roughly as-AT&lt;S : (m^n^', just as for the stan-  dard assumptions*. -    * For footnote see next page.    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    Returning to the standard assumptions, we note  typical computing times for T^ 0 K absorption and  first-order RR pro les. For an exact calculation of the  T= 300 K optical absorption [  01^ Im ^(cu^)} for a  hypothetical system having 100 non-degenerate ther-  mally populated modes of different Stokes loss param-  eters {Xy}, we  nd that the computing time on an  IBM 3081 for 2100 FFT time points is  30sofcpu  time, using eq. (2) and a standard FFT algorithm. The  associated first-order profile for any mode/can be ob-  tained from ^(6J^) via eq. (6) in less than 0.5 s of cpu  time.    In computing ' &gt;(&lt;  i) of eq. (2), one must truncate  the Fourier integral at a sufficiently long time T. Be-  fore considering the truncation error, we note that the  area under the Im ^&gt;(w^) curve is exactly  r:    00                                                                            00    r dcuLlm&lt; &gt;(( ;L)= r F df6(r)exp(--y|rl)i7(r)= r.    (7)    Here the identity T]*(t) = T?( O has been used. Since  just T?(O) was needed for eq. (7), we see that trunca-  tion of the integral in eq. (2) at any time T &gt;  0 changes  the Im   '(t 3i_) curve so as to leave its area constant.  We therefore define the absolute truncation error of  Im $(01^) foi" fixed cui^ to be  .(r, o ^) = |Re.  dr  X exp(ict;i/ - 7?)  n(t)\. Since eq. (4) gives \r)(t)\ &lt; 1  we have      (T, ML) &lt;J dr exp(-70 Ii?(r) 1 &lt; 7-! exp(-7r),    T    and this inequality can be used to obtain an upper  bound on the global relative error    (^(T^CT'^JdcJ^ fCT.CJJi^^C^^lAfcJg exp( -yr),    (8)    where Acxi^ is the spectral range of the absorption band.  The quantity &lt;  S(r) is just the ratio of the area under  the absolute truncation error curve to that under the  Im $(  3^) curve. For typical values 7=15 cm"1 and    * Very recently, Reimers et al. (7], computed T  ^ 0 K optical  absorption spectra using the method of wave packet propaga-  tion in complex time. For the case of harmonic potential  surfaces, their computational procedure appears complicated  compared with exploiting the simplicity of our analytical  formulas for i}(/).     ug = 3500 cm"1 to be used in section 3, we will take  T = 4 ps, giving &lt;SS(r) &lt; 10-3-    It should be noted that truncation errors in the sum-  over-states method are inherently different than those  just discussed. Sum-over-states truncations result in ex-  cluded vibronic peaks at the higher values ofo?^. and  this may be easily checked by integrating the comput-  ed a(u^){Cti^ curve for different truncations   the  exact area must be a temperature-independent constant  (namely TT'TS). This result also holds for arbitrary non-  linear electron phonon coupling, within the Condon  approximation.    Finally, we emphasize that although the first-order  RR profiles computed via eqs. (3) or (6) are exact at  all temperatures, for T^ 0 K one must distinguish be-  tween first-order and one-phonon profiles, as we have  previously detailed [3,4]. At r= 0 IC the first-order  profiles are identical to the corresponding one-phonon  profiles, which are the measured quantities. However.  for r ^ 0 K there are higher-order corrections [3,4]  to the first-order profiles. While these corrections are  straightforward to compute explicitly in a model cal-  culation, we have recently argued [4] that they are gen-  erally negligible for multimode systems characterized  at room temperature by the following criteria: (1) op-  tical absorption curves with well-resolved but overlap-  ping vibronic structure due to high-frequency (no r ^&gt;  kTjTi) modes, and (2) thermal broadening due to a  reservoir of weakly Franck Condon active (X? -^ 1),  thermally populated low-frequency (f^r- ^. kT/h)  modes whose frequencies are smaller than the smallest  resolvable width in the optical absorption spectrum.  In the remainder of this letter we will focus on such  systems.    2.2. Short-time approximation for treating a reservoir  of low-frequency modes    For systems characterized in the preceding para-  graph, the observed vibronic peak widths r (hwhm) are  typically &gt; 100 cm"1, corresponding to "effective" ex-  cited state lifetimes &lt; 1 ps. Since the reduced optical  absorption a.(u^)lu^&lt;x Im  ^(c^) is determined by  the Fourier transform eq. (2), the short effective life-  time implies that the absorption time correlator r)(t)  of eq. (4) is non-negligible only for a short characteris-  tic tune tc of order r" - For e ^t , if the low-frequen-  cy reservoir modes {/'} are sufficiently thermally pop-    611    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    ulated that S.r&lt;&gt;-i X^(2\ ir.&gt;+ l)^-1, one can approx-  imate  ](t) by expanding cos (Uf-t) and sin (Uf. t) to  order t2 for the low-frequency modes in eq.

(4), as will be illustrated in section 3. The re-  placement T?(r)-*- T ^^O constitutes the short-time  approximation (STA), and from eqs. (1) and (2), it  yields a reduced absorption o'(cJi)/( ?i consisting of a  Franck-Condon progression ofvibronic peaks arising  from the high-frequency modes. If 7 is neglected com-  pared with o, each peak is broadened into a gaussian  of hwhm = (2 m 2)l/2a. The STA was used extensively  in ret. [4] to study higher-order profile corrections. In  section 3 we emphasize numerical illustrations of tem-  perature effects, dephasing, and the validity of the  STA*.    3. Numerical illustrations    First, we consider a model consisting of one high-  frequency mode/and a reservoir of^Vg degenerate  low-frequency modes. The subscript E denotes the  Einstein oscillator model for the degenerate modes.  Model parameters are given typical values: ( iy= 800    ^ The short-time approximation (STA) used here is related to  a similar approximation given by Lax 18]. Lax's approxima-  tion applies to all modes of an F-center type system having  a broad structureless optical absorption, whereas our STA  treats just the low-frequency reservoir modes of a system"  with a well-structured optical absorption, as characterized in  the text. Note also that a formula equivalent to eq. (4) for  TI&lt;O was obtained by Lax in an approximation valid to order    UN, where TV is the numbei of modes. However, in refs. [3,  4] an" explicit proof was given that eq. (4) is, in fact,,exact  for arbitrary N within the standard assumptions.    612    cm~1, A&lt;-= 0.5, CUE = 50 cm"1, and 7= 15 cm'^.The  "effective" Stokes loss parameter ^VgAe =2.15 for the  degenerate low-frequency modes is determined from  the STA relation o- = N^ Xg (2 (n^ +1 )  *I , so that  the widths (hwhm) of the high-frequency mode's  vibronic peaks are, for f^a, well approximated by  ^=(21n2)l/2o=250cm-l(o=212cm-l)at^=  300 K. The zero-phonon frequency is taken to be cu^8  = 14892.5 cm-i/which fixes the first peak of our STA  reduced absorption curves at 15000cm"1   note from  eq. (9) that the "effective" zero-phonon frequency in  the STA is t^f +  .{f}  y. cuy.    Defining D,(t) = exp {- X,(2 &lt;n,-&gt; +1) [1 - cos(u,0]},  we illustrate the arguments of section 2.2 by plotting  Df(t)D^(t) exp ( TT) versus time (solid line) in fig. la.  We emphasize that while short-time approximation re-  lations were used above in fixing the values of some of  our model parameters, all of the time-domain curves  of figs. 1 and 2 were calculated from the exact (long-  time) expressions. It is seen in fig. la that for 0 &lt; t &lt;  tc ==0.07 ps, the rapid damping due to the degenerate  low-frequency modes dominates the "natural" damping  exp( 7f).

Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    low-frequency modes obviously prevents their dephas-  ing, as can be seen in the time interval (0.6 ps, 0.75 ps)  and multiples thereof, so that this model produces non-  negligible long-time contributions to the Fourier inte-  gral eq. (2). Using eqs. (2), (4), and (9), we computed  via FFT the Im ^(co^) curves of fig. Ib. The solid curve  was obtained by using the exact 77(0 ofeq. (4) and  doing a long-time FFT (r = 4 ps). It is seen to exhibit  well-resolved lorentzian vibronic fine structures of  spacing 50 cm"1 and widths (hwhm) 7=15 cm~1, su-  perimposed on the vibrational structure due to the  high-frequency modes. The dashed curve was obtained  m the STA by replacing i?(r) by rf^^t) of eq. (9). For  this case it was sufficient to do the FFT for T = 0.1 ps,  and the resulting curve is a Franck Condon progression  of just the high-frequency mode's vibronic lines, with  each line broadened, to an excellent approximation, in-  to a gaussian of hwhm r  250 cm"1 (both a and  y  were included in our STA calculations). Note that the  STA curve threads the exact curve in such a way that  their areas are the same   eq. (7) applies to both curves,  since T?(O) = r]STA(P) = l. The low-frequency mode's  vibronic structures in the exact (solid) curve are real  within the model, but are obviously due to the lack of  dephasing in the simple Einstein oscillator description  for the reservoir modes. For a new-degenerate distribu-  tion of the reservoir modes, dephasing actually renders  the STA (dashed) curve of fig. Ib the more appropriate,  as will now be seen.    To illustrate the long-time dephasing of the reservoir  modes, we simply replace the Einstein oscillator reser-  voir by a reservoir consisting of two subests of modes  with incommensurate frequencies t^gi = 65 cm'"1 and  c ?E2 = 37 cm"1. The corresponding effective Stokes  loss parameters A'F^ EI ^NEI^-E  = 1-05 were chosen  so that o'2- for T= 300 K has the same value as in the  preceding Einstein oscillator case. Keeping the remain-  ing parameters of the model fixed, we computed first  just Df(t) D^(t) exp( 7r), with the results shown in  fig. 2a. The behavior is qualitatively similar to that of  fig. la in that long-time dephasing (t &gt; O.I ps) is ab-  sent. In this model dephasing enters with the inclu-  sion of the second set of N^ modes, for which D^(t)  consists of well-separated peaks, as shown in fig-2b-  From fig. 2c, it is seen that the products ofDf(t)  X Z)g,(f) exp( ft) an .Df^ t) has significant overlap  only in the time interval (0, 0.07 ps), i.e. in the short-  time regime *.

The resulting STA curves are  shown by dashed lines in  gs. 2d and 2e, and they are  barely separable from the exact curves. Thus the short-  time approximation works very well for this case. Note  that because each  &gt;,-(/) satisfies 0 &lt;Dj(t) &lt;  1, the in-  troduction of additional reservoir modes, each with  their own D/Ct), would simply lower the t^O values  of the curve of fig. 2c, thereby improving the short-  time approximation.

USA    Received 22 August 1983; in final form 12 December 1983    The role of the electronic-plasma-resonance absorption of surface microstructure in the visible and UV pulsed laser de-  sorption ofadsorbates on a silver surface is examined. It is shown that the surface microstructure aids in the absorption of  a significant fraction of the laser radiation and can lead to a relatively gentle thermal desorption of molecular monolayers  absorbed on the metal. This substantially increases the sensitivity and selectivity of time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the  analysis of adsorbates on the metal surface.    Recently there has been much interest in the in-  fluence of small-scale metal microstructures on the  properties of surface-adsorbed molecular overlayers.  Rough metal surfaces have been shown to have a  strong influence on the optical scattering processes of  adsorbed molecules, both linear [1] and non-linear  [2], the rate of photochemistry of adsorbed molecules  [3], and the infrared laser induced desorption of ad-  sorbed molecules [4]. In this letter we show that these  same microstructures also have a strong and potentially  important effect on the laser desorption of molecular  overlayers using pulsed visible lasers. High-power  pulsed visible lasers have been widely used as an ana-  lytical probe of small volumes of materials [5 8]. It is  generally believed that the high-power pulse heats the  material it is incident upon, creating a microplasma and  ionizing a small volume of the material [9]. These ions  can then be collected and analyzed with time-of-flight  (TOP) mass spectrometry. However, while this tecluu-  que is very sensitive, it suffers from two problems    Present address: The Curiosity Shop: Creative Ideas in  Science Education, 280 24th Avenue, San Francisco, Cali-  fornia 94121, USA.    which have heterofore precluded its widespread appli-  cation to surface adsorbates [10,11]- First the relative-  ly high powers necessary tend to vaporize a substantial  amount of the material, making the separation of the  bulk and surface species difficult, and second, the high  powers used tend to fragment the molecular species  being analyzed, complicating the identification of the  parent molecules. We show that both these short-  comings can be minimized by taking advantage of the  unique optical properties of surface microsiructures.  We are able to desorb and analyze a small fraction of a  surface adsorbed monolayer, and we show that the ad-  sorbate can be laser desorbed sufficiently gently that  the parent ion is the predominant species. This is po-  tentially a powerful and general technique for the an-  alysis of surface adsorbates.    The samples studied were silver island  lms of 50  A mass thickness produced by thermal evaporation at    1  /s onto polished quartz substrates heated to 150 C.  The films consisted of islands, roughly circular in cross  section, with a typical diameter of 200 A, and covering  30 40% of the surface. After evaporation, the films  were exposed to atmosphere and spin-coated from a  solution of 10~3 mole/C paranitrobenzoic acid in    615    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    ethanol. At this concentration, a monolayer of para-  nitr benzoate is adsorbed onto the silver-island films  [1]. The islands themselves formed the surface micro-  structures and these films exhibited excellent surface-  enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra from ad-  sorbed molecules. The full optical behavior of these  island films, and the role played by the nucrostructure  in the anomalous optical scattering properties of ad-  sorbates has been fully determined [1] and was well  characterized by their absorption spectra [12]. A typi-  cal extinction spectrum, which has the same spectral  behavior as the absorption, is shown in fig. 1.    We used a commercial laser desorption, time-of-  flight (TOF) mass spectrometer which employs a Nd:    YAG pulsed laser to vaporize and ionize the sample.  The laser was equipped with harmonic generators to  provide either 266 or 532 nm radiation with. a pulse  width of 10 15 ns. The laser beam was focused onto  the sample by a 10X microscope objective. The laser  energy density at the sample was estimated from the  measured damage spot size on the film after a high-  power shot and the total energy m the laser pulse mea-  sured with a calibrated calorimetric photometer. The  ion collection optics are directly in line with the laser  beam and, for this experiment, were several millimeters  from the sample surface. This geometry required that  the laser beam pass through the substrate and then  the sample. The sample and TOF spectrometer were  maintained at 13 X 10-3 Pa (10-6 Torr).          200    300    400    500    600  - WAVELENGTH (nm)    700    Fig. 1. Extinction spectrum of a 50   mass thickness silver is-  land film coated with a monolayer of paranitrobenzoate.    616    Using a tightly focused incident beam at 266 nm,  energy densities ofasO.5 J/cm^ were achieved in a 14  pm diameter spot. These powers were sufficient to  cause marked ablation of the film, leaving a well-de-  fined damage spot on which there appeared to be little  or no silver remaining. Presumably most of the film  material within the spot ;vas vaporized, and the result-  ing TOF mass spectra contained strong Ag ion peaks in  both the negative and positive ion spectra. Organic frag-  ments were more prevalent in the negative current    mode since proton liberation and molecular fragmenta-  tion usually generates negative ions [9]. A typical nega-  tive ion spectrum obtained from a bare (uncoated) Ag  film is shown in fig. 2a. The primary peaks at 107 and  109 atomic mass units (amu) are due to the two silver  isotopes. Several of the other peaks can also be readily  identified. Those at 35 and 37 amu are due to Cl~ ions  which presumably are left on the substrate during an  HC1 rinse in its cleaning. Peaks at 120 (Si^O?, 76  (SiO?, and 60 (SiO^) amu can be attributed to ma-  terial from the fused quartz substrate. The remaining  peaks are due to unidentified impurities either in or on  the silver itself or the quartz substrate. Their presence  is not surprising, since the quartz substrate is subjected  to numerous solvent rinses in the cleaning process prior  to the film fabrication, and the silver films were rou-  tinely stored in air for a day or two prior to the laser  mass spectra being taken-    The negative ion TOF mass spectrum of a silver-  island tilm coated with a monolayer ( 6 X 1014 mole-  cules/cm2) of paranitrobenzoate is shown in fig. 2b. It  is nearly identical to that of the uncoated film in the  position and relative intensities of the peaks, with few  exceptions. These are the relatively weak peaks at 166,  122, and 46 amu, which can be respectively assigned  to the parent paranitrubenzoate ion, (M H)~, as well  as the fragments of the parent minus the CO^, (M H   C02)~, and the N03 ion itself. Thus we are clearly  detececting the presence of the organic surface ad-  sorbate in the TOF mass spectrum of the desorbed  ions. In contrast as shown in fig. 3, the positive ion  Spectrum had relatively few peaks, with virtually none  of the impurity peaks and no evidence of the surface  adsorbate. Instead, we observe the two Ag1" isotope  peaks at 107 and 109 amu, as well as those peaks at-  tributed to silver clusters, Ag^, centered at 216 amu.  We also see small peaks at 151 and 153 amu which we  attribute to (Ag + CO^'f1' complexes, and which are    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984           60   35 37        76       107       lll09  Hi l ,ll ...

Similar behavior, for  both the positive and negative ion mass spectra and  for both coated and uncoated Huns, was obtained when  532 nm radiation was used.    Although we are clearly able to detect the surface-  adsorbed molecules, substantially better sensitivity to  the specific organic adsorbate was obtained by reduc-  ing the energy density of the incident laser pulse.

Both spectra were obtained with 266 nm excitation.    shows only a very slight change in the optical appear-  ance of the Him rather than the pronounced damage  spot observed at higher powers. In addition, identical  TOF spectra of the adsorbed paranitrobenzoate could  be obtained from the same spot with  5 successive  laser pulses, suggesting that  lO9 molecules are de-  sorbed each shot. Irradiation of an uncoated film at  similar energy densities gave only the Ag peaks in the  TOF spectrum, with no impurities or adsorbates ob-  servable.    For comparison, TOF mass spectra of crystals of  paranitrobenzoic acid were obtained, as shown in fig.  4a. While the molecule in the bulk crystal is slightly  different than the surface-adsorbed species, and may  have a different fragmentation pattern, the spectra  show considerably more impurity and fragment peaks  than those of the surface-adsorbed molecules obtained  with low powers from the silver islands. To confirm  the critical role of the surface microstructure, we also  obtained TOF mass spectra from laser-desorbed para-  nitrobenzoate adsorbed on a relatively smooth silver  surface. A monolayer of paranitrobenzoate was ad-  sorbed on a TEM grid coated with a thick layer of  silver or on a piece of silver shot and the exciting laser  was aligned to impinge on the edge of the sample. A  typical spectrum is shown in fig. 4b for 266 nm excita-    618    tion, and is very similar to the TOF spectra of the  coated island films obtained with high powers. How-  ever, when the laser power was reduced, we were un-  able to obtain the same impurity-free TOF spectra of  paranitrobenzoate from the smooth surface that were  obtained from the silver islands. These results demon-  strate that the surface microstructure both increases  the sensitivity of the laser desorption mass spectra to  surface adsorbed molecules and reduces the parent ion  fragmentation-  While thermal laser desorption mass spectrometry  does not require a rough silver surface [10], the exis-  tence of the microstructure certainly can improve the  sensitivity of the technique to adsorbates on the metal  surface. To determine the role of the electronic plasma  resonances of the surface microstructure in the desorp-  tion process, we measured the dependence of the  strength of the paranitrobenzoate ion peaks on the in-  cident laser power density. We found that the threshold  powers for desorption, as well as the power dependence  of the signal at low energy densities were identical at  266 and 532 nm excitation, to within our experimental  accuracy. On these island films, all the incident power  is absorbed in the silver islands themselves, and from  the measured absorption spectrum, we find that the  fractional absorption in the films is approximately the    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    same at both 266 and 532 run. In contrast, from the  studies of the optical scattering of adsorbates on these   lms, we know that the strength of the local electro-  magnetic field at the surface of the islands is, on aver-  age, considerably stronger at 532 nm than at 266 nm.  In fact, using the same model that accounts for the  excitation spectrum of SERS on these island films  [12], we can estimate that the local field strength at  the island surface for 532 nm radiation is, on average,   50 times greater than for 266 nm radiation.    The fact that we observe no increase in the efficien-  cy for laser desorption at 532 nm compared to 266 nm  precludes any desorption mechanism which depends on  the strength of the local field at the surface adsorbed  molecule. Instead, the desorption mechanism is most  likely purely thermal in nature, and results from the  heating of the silver islands. This apparently causes the  surface molecule bond to break first, since it is weaker  than the silver silver bonds of the metal. The weaker  bond strength is indeed bom out by the observation  that the SERS signal disappears when the coated films  are heated above 250 C, presumably because of desorp-  tion of the surface-adsorbed paranitrobenzoate [13].  The role of the silver surface microstructure in the de-  sorption process is two-fold. It serves to improve the  penetration of the electromagnetic field into the silver,  allowing a more efficient absorption of the incident  laser power. Furthermore, the surface roughness tends '  to localize the thermal energy in the vicinity of the ad-  sorbates, rather than heating the bulk substrate as  would occur for a smooth surface. The combination  of these effects leads to the observed improvement in  the thermal desorption of the surface adsorbates and in  the resulting TOP spectrometry.    The thermal nature of the desorption process suggests  that the use of surface microstructure is not limited to  silver and could prove to be a rather general aid in apply-  ing this technique to the study of the molecular make-  up of surface-adsorbed monolayers. The penetration of  the laser field into any metal will be increased by sur-  face roughness, and the heating which results should  cause a similar improvement in the application of laser-  desorption mass spectrometry to the adsorbates. We  note that this might prove particularly useful in the  study of adsorbates on dispersed catalysts, where the  laser power could be absorbed primarily in the metal  particles, rather than the support, allowing selective  desorption of adsorbates from the catalyst itself. Final-  ly, since we are able to see signal from the adsorbate  for many laser shots from the same spot on the film,  and since the signal to noise is still relatively high. de-  tection of submonolayer coverage of surface adsorbates  should be quite feasible. This suggests that this techni-  que has the potential of being an excellent and power-  ful analytical probe of the molecular nature of surface  adsorbates-    References    [ 1 ] DA- Weitz, S.

USA    Received 21 December 1982; in final form 21 March 1983    Product yields and collision density are calculated for nuclear-recoil tritium ions generated in situ with 4 Mkcal/mole of  translational energy in gaseous methane or methane mixed with argon. The distribution of collision experienced in the re-  active region and the yield of stable products are independent of the starting energy when it is large.    1. Introduction    The collision density or collision spectrum, n (E),  is the distribution of collisional energies experienced  by a system [1 ]. For thermal systems, the collision  spectrum is defined by the familiar Boltzmann ex-  pression [2]. The form of this function is a topic of  considerable interest when a reactive component is  introduced into an experiment by nuclear-recoil [I],  photochemical [3,4], or beam [5,6] processes. It is  expected that n(E) is influenced by the number and  - type of reactive collision partners available and the  presence of inert moderators and scavengers [1,7 14].    The nuclear-reco  process converts mass defect in-  to kinetic energy [15] - This release of millions of kcal/  mole of energy accelerates the resultant nuclear pro-  jectile away from its electrons. Subsequent collisions    degrade the translationally energized, or hot, ion's  velocity. As it slows electrons can be accumulated,  collisional reionization may occur, and eventually  the hot atom's speed decreases to the range where  chemical reactions occur. Reactive processes can rein-  ject the same atom into the system by decomposition  pathways. Ultimately the original hot atom is removed  from the system by formation of a chemically stable  reaction product, by a thermal scavenger, or by wall  reactions [1].    One of the Editors (RNZ) regrets that the first printing of  this paper had a page of text inadvertently ommited. This  letter is reprinted here in fulL    620    Traditionally the collisional history of the nuclear-  recoil problem has been partitioned into two domains.  Nuclear physicists have focused on the ionic processes  operative at very high velocities and the manner in  which the kinetic energy of the ion is partitioned,  called the "stopping power", among the various chan-  nels and particles in the early stages of the radiation  process [16]- Hot-atom chemists liave been concerned  with reactions of the uncharged atom after it has  slowed down to energies less than a few thousand kcal/  mole [1].    Wolfgang and Estrup [17,18] derived a kinetic the-  ory procedure to calculate the average logarithmic  energy-loss parameter, called a, by using experimen-  tal yields, approximate collision diameters, and a hard-  sphere model for non-reactive scattering. The conse-  quences of more realistic non-reactive interaction po-  tentials have been examined with integral methods  evolved from Boltzmann formalism [8 10,19 30]  and with Monte Carlo stochastic techniques [13,14,31]-  When included, reaction probabilities have been taken  from trajectory results [10,12,14,30]. The integral  methods vary the number of integration cycles, step  size, and upper limit on the integral until the computed  product yields become invariant. The stochastic meth-  od also expects product yields to be insensitive to the  energy at which the sequence is initiated, as long as it  is large.    We recently confirmed this expectation in a stochast-  ic simulation of the systematics of nuclear-recoil tri-    0 009-2614/84/S 03.00   Eisevier Science Publishers B.V.  (North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    tium in the presence ofCH4 and CD^ [14]. This com-  putation included rotationally corrected RRKM (Rice   Ramsberger Kassel Marcus) calculations of the uni-  molecular rates of decomposition of collisionally excited  target molecules and the excited substitution products  of the hot-atom reactions [32]. These results compared  remarkably well with absolute laboratory yields from  nuclear-recoil experiments and photochemical [3]  yields despite the classical nature of the trajectory cal-  culation and the approximations in the model [33 36].  However generation of T in situ from the ^He(n,p)T  process forms T4" with more than 4 million kcal/mole  of translational energy- The actual distribution of colli-  sional energies could be sufficiently different from the  predicted form ofn(E) that the calculated agreement  and consistency could be an artifact of the technique  and may in fact have no physical significance.    To qualitatively examine this issue we have initiated  the stochastic simulation at 4 X 106 kcal/mole and in-  cluded the following ionic processes for M = CH4 and  M=Ar:    T1- + M -^ T1- + M-*-+ e-    T-+ M -&gt; T + M-1-    (1)    (2)    (3)    We describe the computational method and the results  in the following two sections.    2. Computational method    Product yields were simulated by the stochastic  method which uses probability functions and Monte  Carlo sampling [13,14,31]. The recording cycle be-  gins by assigning a starting energy of 4 Mkcal/mole to  the tritium ion. A collision partner and type of event,  target ionization, reaction (1); or charge transfer, re-  action (2), are selected on the basis of the mole-frac-  tion composition of the system and the energy-depen-  dent single-collision cross sections which have been mea-  sured [36-41].    If the interaction ionizes the collision partner, the  T1" is recycled after Monte Carlo selection of its new  laboratory energy, E', from the single-collision proba-  bility distribution, P(E,E'), at initial energy E. For  each collision, the required P(E,E') distribution is    interpolated from distributions tabulated at the two  nearest energies for which laboratory measurements  of the ejected electron energies have been made  [36^1].    If the event produces a neutral T atom, its new lab-  oratory energy is calculated by approximating the  collisional energy loss as the simple monoenergetic  difference between the ground-state ionization poten-  tials of the collision partners. In processes (1) through  (3) we have completely neglected interactions which  leave the residual partner excited because little experi-  mental information is available on such events [42,43].  Born-approximation calculations on processes like H'*'  + H(ls) -&gt; H"1' + H( p) indicate that at lower energies.  for example below a hundred thousand kcal/mole, ex-  citation of the residual partner can account for as  much as 20% of the total stopping power of the medi-  um [16,44 50]. The experimental uncertainties in  the value of the cross sections are also = 20%.

Cross sections for reionization of T, reaction (3),  have been measured [38]. The secondary probability  distributions for the energy of the resultant T^ were  calculated from the kinetic-energy distributions for  first generation of secondary electrons predicted by  Born-approximation calculations for 2H(ls) -&gt; H+    621    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 February 1984    + e- + H [44]. The limits applicable to these distribu-  tions were modified for the appropriate differences in  ionization potentials.-    '         - -    Single-collision information from classical trajectory  studies provided cross-section functions and secondary  probability distributions for the lower-energy scatter-  ing, reaction (4), and reactive processes: abstraction,  reaction (6); substitution, with and without inversion,  reaction (9); and decomposition, reactions (5), (7) and  (8) [51,S2].TheunimolecularratesofCH4 andC^T    decomposition (^CHs-H' ^CHa-T and ^CHzT-K m  reactions (5), (7), and (8) respectively) were calculated  by the rotationally corrected version ofRRKM theory  [32]. The remaining RRKM parameters (geometry of  the critical configuration.

If the event leaves the T free, reactions (4), (5) and  (7), the cycle is restarted with the new laboratory en-  ergy,  "', of T computed and recorded as described in  r f. [14]. If the T is incorporated into a stable product,  reactions (6) and (9), or is thermalized by the colli-  sion, the result is recorded at that energy and a new  T1" ion is initiated at 4 Mkcal/mole of energy. The  tracking is repeated until the statistical noise of the  calculation is comparable to the experimental uncer-  tainty [2,33-35].    3. Results    Fig. 1 shows the entire collision spectrum predicted  for the T + CH4 system for various values of the initial  energy in the absence of reactions involving ions [14].  Several features are evident here which have been ob-  served in other calculations [12,13]. Prisant et al. [13]  noted the sensitivity of the height of the peaks at the  ends of the spectrum to the value of the starting ener-  gy. Spicer and Malerich [12] have demonstrated the  reactive depletion of the low-energy peak by compar-  ing n(E) distributions with and without the reactive  process, while some of these features appear to Tie  more or less prominent, depending upon the value of    622          Fig. 1.

The differences observed  in the first and last recording bins are unimportant  because the reactive cross sections are small in these  regions.    Fig. 3 illustrates the collision fraction developed by  280 T1" ions subjected to processes (1) through (9)  when the initial energy was 4 Mkcal/mole. More than  a million collisions were recorded by the simulations  which generated this  gure. The calculated absolute  yields are: 16   2% HT, 18   3% CH^'T (18% inverted).  24   3% CH^ , 20   2% CH3 by reaction (5), and less  than 1% CH3 by reaction (7). Fig. 3 also plots the col-  lision fraction reported in fig. 6 of r f. [14] which in-  cluded only processes (4) through (9) and were initi-  ated at a much lower energy. The computed yields re-  ported in r f. [14] are: 20   2%, 21   4% (28%), 22    2%, 21   2%, and less than 2% respectively. The  yields reported here are lower and the uncertainties  are larger, as expected from the calibration studies re-  ported in r f. [14], because the sample size is smaller.  Experimental values are available for the absolute nu-  clear-recoil yield of HT, 20%, and the total CH3 T  yield is 25%. The experimental uncertainty is ^5%  [1,33-35].    The predicted amount of decomposition is again  larger than indicated by the measurements (5%), how-        0 4  FCE         0.2   ^T  ^         ^^  a a  -Till 1111 1111 i ! i r"i iiii    200    400    600    800    1000    Fig. 3.

The abscissa is the laboratory ener-  gy of the T"" ion or T atom in kcal/mole.    ever, the implications of this result are unclear as dis-  cussed in r f. [14].    We additionally examined the effect of including  another set of reactions (1) through (4) appropriate  to the presence of an Ar inert moderator, see fig. 3.  More than a million events were also sampled by the  272 T1" ions tracked in this system. The computed  product yields are: 11   2% HT. 12   3% Cl ^T (19%  inverted), 12   3% loss of H from CH3T, 11   27o de-  composition of CH4, and less than 1% loss of T from  CH3T. Without the ionic energy-loss channels [14],  see fig. 3, the same yields are: 14   2%, 13   2% (24%  inverted), 10   2%, 9   1%, and ^=1%. In an Ar/CH4  mixture which is 90% Ar, the experimental yield of  HT is 7% and the yields of CH3  is 12% [37].    The general features of the self-moderated and  argon-moderated collision densities are maintained  when the ionic energy-loss channels are included. The  consistency ofthe;z( ") distribution in this region sup-  ports the standard methods employed in hot-atom  yield calculations which do not include the initial  physics [10,14,30]. The total number of collisions  tabulated and the number of tritiums tracked in each  of the simulations of fig. 3 were different. For this  reason, the abscissa in fig. 3 is the fraction of collisions.  f^, through the region plotted. While the n(E) distri-  butions in fig. 1 are obviously different when the en-  tire spectrum is considered, they generate the same  product yields, within the computed uncertainties,  because it is the distribution through the reactive re-  gion, figs. 2 and 3, which is important.    In conclusion, computed absolute product yields  for nuclear-recoil reactions are insensitive to the ini-  tial energy of the hot atom when that value is high  compared to the energies at which stable products  can be formed. The general shape of the collision den-  sity in the chemically reactive region appears to be un-  affected by reactions (1) through (3). A quasiclassical  trajectory study on a potential-energy hypersurface  with more realistic details could indicate whether or  not the decomposition issue is important.

In considering a manuscript for publication, particular attention will be  given to the originality of the research, the desirability of speedy publication, the clarity of presentation and the  validity of the conclusions.    Submission: Contributions, written in English, should be sent to one of the editors or, preferably, to a member  of the advisory editorial board who is familiar with the research reported. The manuscript should be submitted in  triplicate, of which one is a clear master copy with original figures (see below).  The full addresses of the members of the Advisory Editorial Board will be found at the beginning of every volume.    Refereeing: All contributions submitted will be refereed. The editors reserve the right to reject manuscripts and  to edit contributions when necessary.    Comments section: The editors welcome comments on Letters published in the Journal or elsewhere. They will  be placed in a separate section. Comments will be refereed as usual and treated as normal contributions.    Publication speed: The editors and publishers cooperate closely to ensure minimal publication delays. All proof-  reading will be done by the publishers and proofs are not sent to the author(s). If the manuscript submitted can-  not be processed immediately due to the author's failure to meet the length and stylistic requirements (see below)  or because scientific revisions are required, the delay thus resulting will be indicated by the addition of the date  of receipt of the manuscript in final form.    Publication scheme: Chemical Physics Letters will be published weekly.    Page charge and reprints: There is no page charge. Reprints may be ordered from the publisher; an order form is  sent to contributors upon acceptance of their Letter.    Copyright transfer: Upon acceptance of an article, auihor(s) resident in the USA will be asked to transfer copy-  right of the article to the publisher. This transfer will ensure the widest possible diss mination of information  under the US Copyright Law.    Correspondence: All correspondence with the editors or publishers should contain full reference to the paper con-  cerned, i.e., the names of all the authors, the full title, as well as the date of submission. Once the contribution  has been accepted for publication, all further correspondence should be sent directly to the publishers and not to  the editors (Drs. M.D. Nauta, Editorial Department, North-Holland Publishing Company, P.O. Box 103, 1000 AC  Amsterdam, The Netherlands; telephone number (020&gt;762079).    Preparation of manuscripts: The following are the stylistic requirements for an acceptable manuscript.    (1) Title: The title should be brief and yet convey to the informed reader the nature of the contents of the paper.    (2) Address: The name(s) of the author(s) and the name and address of the institute where the research work  was done should be indicated on the manuscript. The name of the author to whom correspondence is to be  addressed should be underlined.    637    Volume 104, number 6    CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS    24 Februaiy 1984    (3) Abstract: An abstract of approximately 50 words is required. It should contain the keywords of the paper  as well as the essence of the results.    (4) Length: Manuscripts should not exceed 2000 words (8 typewritten pages of text, plus references and figure  captions and no more than four figures). They should be typed double-spaced with a wide margin. All pages  should be numbered.    (5) - Units: The use of SI units is strongly recommended. --    (6) Figures: The drawings for the figures must be submitted on separate sheets, drawn in black India ink and  carefully lettered with the use of stencils. The lettering as well as the essential details should have propor-  tionate dimensions so as not to become illegible or unclear after the usual reduction by the printers (ideal  lettering size after reduction of the drawing to one-column width is 1.8 mm). The drawings should prefera-  bly be of the same size as the typescript and designed for a reduction factor in print of two to three. Instead  of original drawings, sharp and contrasty glossy prints of about typescript size are also acceptable. Each  drawing should have a figure number and a caption; the captions should be collected on a separate sheet.  ' The appropriate place of each figure in the text should be indicated in the margin.    (7) Formulae: Displayed formulae should be numbered and typed or clearly and unambiguously written by  hand. Symbols requiring bold-face type, like vectors, etc., should be identified properly in the margin of the  manuscript. Long equations should be avoided as much as possible by introduction of suitable abbreviations  of component expressions. Special attention should be paid to symbols that can easily be misread, such as  i (lower case), I (cap.), 1 (el), 1 (one), ' (prime), o (lower case), 0 (cap.), 0 (zero),   (degree), u, v (vee),  v (Greek nu), V (cap.), x, X, X, z. Z, p. P, p (Greek rho), etc.    (8) Tables: Tables should be typed on separate sheets and each table should have a number and a title. The  appropriate places for the insertion of the tables should be indicated in the margin.    (9) References: In the text, reference to other parts of the paper should be made by section (or equation) num-  ber, not by page number. References to other papers should be consecutively numbered in the text and  should be listed by number on a separate sheet at the end of the paper. The references should be as com-  plete as possible and be presented as follows:    For a book:    A. Messiah, Quantum mechanics. Vol. 2 (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1970).  For a paper in a journal:    I. Kaplan and J. Jortner, Chem. Phys. 32 (1978) 38i -  For a paper in a contributed volume:    G-I. Hofacker, Y. Mar chal and M. Ratner, in: The hydrogen bond.
